</div>

<p><i>Experiences of an American Woman During the
German Invasion</i></p>

<p><i>Told by Madame Laura de Gozdawa Turczynowicz</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the story of an American woman, the wife of a Polish
noble, who was caught in her home by the floodtide of the
German invasion of the ancient kingdom of Poland. It is a
straightforward narrative, terribly real, of her experiences in
the heart of the eastern war-zone, of her struggle with the
extreme conditions, of her Red Cross work, of her fight for the
lives of her children and herself against the dread Typhus, and
at last, of her release and journey through Germany and Holland
to this country; and it is offered to the public as typical of
the experiences of hundreds of other cultured Polish women.
How truly she was in line of the German advance may be
appreciated from the fact that iron-handed von Hindenberg for
some days made his headquarters under her roof. A few of
her hundreds of interesting experiences are told below by permission
of her publishers, <i>G. P. Putnam's Sons</i>: Copyright 1916.</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
I&mdash;STORY OF THE POLISH NOBLES</p>

<p>Very near the borderline between Russia and Germany
lies Suwalki. It was a delightful, old-fashioned
spot full of homes, and with many estates in the neighborhood.
As one says in Polish, there were there very
many of the "intelligence," meaning the noble class. People
who were proud of the heirlooms, the old and valuable
furniture, the beautiful pictures and books contained
in their homes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>Into this old-world peace, came war, and of the homes
and people, there is left only destruction and hopeless
gray misery. How well I remember, and with what astonishment
I think upon all that was before war was
declared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My children were crying from the discomfort of being
awakened so early, and had raised their voices in
protest at the general state of disorder.</p>

<p>These three were Wanda, six years, and Stanislaw and
Wladislaw, twin boys, five years! I think they were also
protesting that no one was paying the slightest attention
to them, and that was a state of affairs to which they
were not used!...</p>


<p>II&mdash;THE FALL OF KING ALCOHOL</p>

<p>I think it was about a week after the first news when
the Ukase of the Czar was published&mdash;that all spirits were
to be destroyed, and the use of alcohol forbidden. What
excitement prevailed over this announcement in a country
where at dinner one must reckon at least one bottle
of wodka for each guest! Such strong stuff was it that
the only time I ever tried it I thought my last moment
had come! The day before the official destruction was
to take place we went to get alcohol for the hospital&mdash;both
the pure, and the colored for burning in lamps, etc.
There were tremendous crowds about, all struggling to
get a last bottle to drink, already drunken&mdash;without
shame, and horrid! I thought then what a wonderful
thing the Czar had done for humanity. How brave it
was deliberately to destroy a tremendous source of income<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
in order to help his people! We were forced to
have police protection to bring the bottles home. Such
bottles! Each one holding twelve quarts!</p>

<p>The next day we saw the destruction of the "Monopol."
The chief of police ordered all spirits carried to
the top of a hill in the outskirts of Suwalki&mdash;then with
much ceremony the bottles were smashed, letting the fiery
stuff flow in streams! What cries there were from the
people&mdash;the peasants threw themselves down on the
ground, lapped the wodka with their tongues, and when
they could swallow no more they rolled over and over
in it! After a while my husband thought it better to
leave; even in an automobile there was little safety
among such mad creatures. We were very glad when
"King Alcohol" had been vanquished, and we shuddered
to think what would have been if such an orgy had taken
place without police to quell it!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About nine o'clock a peasant came to tell me the Germans
were coming! Some one had seen them. I made
the four soldiers eat, and gave them food and cigarettes
to carry with them. They were ill men. After a mutual
blessing they went back to await their fate.</p>

<p>Suddenly hearing an uproar, I saw some of the bad
elements of the town looting, searching for food, knocking
each other down, screaming&mdash;a horrid sight! The
Jews who were always so meek, had now more self-assertion,
strutting about, stretching up until they looked
inches taller. It was hard work to tear myself away
from the balcony. I, too, seemed unable to control
myself, running from the balcony to the child and from
the child to the balcony.</p>

<p>At eleven the streets again grew quiet, the time was
near, and I saw the first <i>pikel-haube</i> come around the
corner, rifle cocked&mdash;on the lookout for snipers!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE "OLD WOMAN SPY"</p>

<p>The first one was soon followed by his comrades.
Then an officer, who rounded the corner, coming to a
stop directly before our windows. An old Jewess stepped
out and saying, "<i>Guten Tag</i>," handed him a packet of
papers, and gave various directions with much gesticulation.
A spy at our very door! A woman I had seen
many times! Busy with Wladek I saw no more for a
while when a cry from the two other children made me
rush to the window. They were coming into our court.
The soldiers! And in a moment rushed into the room
where we were, in spite of the signs tacked up on all
doors "Tyfus." Seeing me in the Red Cross uniform
they held back a moment. One bolder than his comrades
laughed, saying, "She is trying to deceive us," and
came toward me with a threatening gesture. Then with
all my fear, God gave me strength to defy them. In
German, which fortunately I speak very well, I asked
what they wanted.</p>

<p>"Food and quarters."</p>

<p>"You cannot stop here. There is typhus."</p>

<p>"Show us the ill ones."</p>

<p>Opening the door to my own bedroom where the child
lay, talking, moving the little hands incessantly, I saw
that the nurse from the excess of fright had crawled
under the bed. The soldier yanked her out, saying he
would not hurt her, chucked her under the chin, and
called her a "pretty animal!" Poor Stephinia, she could
hardly stand! I, in my anxiety, pushed the soldier from
the room, to find the others already making themselves
at home.</p>

<p>"You cannot stop here. Go away! I am not afraid
of you; I am an American. If you do any harm to us
the world shall hear of it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>They had been drinking, and the very fact that I defied
them made an impression.</p>

<p>"Go out on the road. I will send food to you."</p>

<p>They went. One of them, giving me a look of sympathy,
said:</p>

<p>"You have my sympathy, Madame."</p>

<p>That gave me courage, and shutting the door I went
back to my boy. Always the same; I should not have
left his side for an instant.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;INVASION OF AN AMERICAN WOMAN'S
HOME</p>

<p>The town by now was in an uproar, every one seemed
screaming together. As I looked from the window, my
hand touched the prayer-book lying on the table.</p>

<p>"Lord, give me a word, a promise, to keep me steadfast
and sane!" The book opened at the 55th Psalm&mdash;"As
for me I will call upon God, and the Lord shall save
me." Even in the stress of the moment reading to the
end of the chapter&mdash;"Cast thy burden on the Lord." A
conviction came to me then that God would keep us all
safe!</p>

<p>Soon I had to wake to the fact that the house was
being looted. Jacob, his wife, and daughter ran into the
room. The soldiers had been knocking them about, taking
all the food they could lay their hands upon. It was
pandemonium let loose! An under-officer came to make
a levy on my food for the army going through to Augustowo.
He, with his men, looked into every hole and corner,
but did not think to look inside the couches, which
were full of things! To see your provisions carried off
by the enemy is not a pleasant sensation. I asked the
under-officer if it were possible the town was to be looted
and burned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Looted&mdash;yes&mdash;to revenge East Prussia! Burned, not
yet,&mdash;not unless we go!"</p>

<p>These first men had a black cover drawn over their
caps and afterwards I heard they were from the artillery.
Always the worst! Just at this time there was a
great tramping of horses right in the rooms under us&mdash;where
the hospital had been arranged&mdash;a thundering
knock on the door, and a captain with his staff walked
in. A tremendously big man, he seemed to fill the
place!</p>

<p>"<i>Guten Tag.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Guten Tag, meine Schwester&mdash;Hier habe ich quartier.</i>"</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid of typhus?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense&mdash;we are all inocculated. Is there really
typhus?"</p>

<p>"Have you a doctor, Captain? Let him decide!"</p>

<p>A very fat boy just from the university was presented
to me; so young, twenty-three and inexperienced, to
have such a responsibility. Examining Wladek he decided
it was dysentery, and tore down my notices!</p>

<p>As there was no appeal, I tried to be amiable. The
<i>Herr Kapitain</i> was not so bad; he cleared the house out,
and at least only orderlies came through; but for us
was left only the bedroom. Children, servants, all packed
together with the typhus patient. The captain was courteous
enough, but said I would have to feed staff and
men. That day seemed endless. With every moment
came fresh troops, and I was glad the <i>Herr Kapitain</i>
was in my apartments. At least there would be no
looting. The rest of the house was full to overflowing
with soldiers. Naturally they blamed the horrible disorder
there on to the Russians. A telephone was soon
in operation, and we were headquarters. All sorts of
wires there were, and a rod sticking out of the roof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
We were forbidden to go near that part of the house.</p>

<p>Every few minutes some one came to ask me to help
them; the poor people, they thought I could make the
soldiers give up pig or horse or chickens. At six the
captain told me he wished supper in half an hour. The
cook seemed on the verge of losing her reason with some
one continually making a raid on the kitchen, but she
managed to get ready by seven. There were eight officers
at the table&mdash;and they demanded wine.</p>

<p>"I have no wine."</p>

<p>"The old Jewess told us you brought home two bottles
of wine when the Russians left."</p>

<p>"That was given me for my children."</p>

<p>"The children have no typhus, the doctor says, so they
do not need wine&mdash;bring it to us."</p>

<p>So I gave up my precious bottles. The forage-wagons
of the Germans had not come; they had no food with
them and no wines, but the town fed them to the last
mouthful. They turned in at half-past ten, leaving an
atmosphere you could cut. It was so thick with tobacco
smoke! Once more I could be without interruption with
my children, for I had to serve the officers, pour their
tea, etc.; it seemed as if one could not live through another
such day. My boy was unconscious,&mdash;talking&mdash;talking&mdash;talking&mdash;all
night long&mdash;no rest for me!...</p>


<p>V&mdash;NIGHT OF TERROR&mdash;SACKED BY
GERMANS</p>

<p>The night wore away. The child grew terribly weak
about four o'clock, and it seemed as if he were going
and were held only by sheer force of my desire. If he
could only sleep! Stas slept restlessly. Little Wanda
was sorry for her mother, constantly waking to ask why
Mammy did not lie down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>When six o'clock came the Captain thundered in, demanding
breakfast, and hoping I had slept well.</p>

<p>Arousing those poor people lying about on the floor,
I freshened my own costume, trying to look as formal
as possible. There was no bread. The Captain, informed
of this, brought a loaf. They finished my butter,
and drank an enormous amount of coffee. As I served
them the cook came to tell me a lot of people were waiting,
begging me to intercede for them. An old man
rushed in after her, threw himself on the floor, kissing
my hands and knees, weepingly telling how the soldiers
had held him, had taken his two young daughters, had
looted the hut, even to his money buried in the earth of
the floor. They had then gone, taking the girls with
them. The poor father crawled around the table, kissing
the officers' hands. They laughed uproariously when one
gave him a push which sent him sprawling over the
floor.</p>

<p>The Captain, seeing my look of disgust (I learned to
conceal my feelings better afterwards), asked me, "Whatever
was the trouble&mdash;why he howled so!"</p>

<p>After I told him what had happened the Captain looked
black and silent for a moment; then said he could do
nothing. The girls now belonged to the soldiers, and I
even saw he was sorry. One of the others, however,
laughed, saying the father was foolish to have stopped
about when he was not wanted. That was my introduction
to Prussian <i>Schrecklichkeit</i>.</p>

<p>The other people waiting had mostly been turned out
of doors while the soldiers slept in their beds, or were
asking help to get back a pig or a horse, or else they were
injured. I told them to go away and be glad they had
their lives, that just now there was no help, but I would
do all that lay in my power.</p>

<p>We heard the sound of battle all that day over Augustowo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
way. It seemed already like a friend, our only connection
with the world. Another day of miserable
anxiety, the boy always worse, and the trouble of providing
food for all those men. I knew that a friendly
seeming attitude on my part was our salvation. The
Captain under all his gruffness had a kind heart, but
even in that short time I had learned what the German
system means. Their idea is so to frighten people that
all semblance of humanity is stamped out! Every time
something awful happened they said there was East Prussia
to pay for.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was about dinner-time ... the officers were just
about to sit down when my cook rushed in crying out
that two soldiers came into the kitchen&mdash;while one held
her (I am sure he bore the marks of her nails!) the
other ran off with a ham and the potatoes ready for the
table.</p>

<p>The officers were furious, and went out to find the culprits.
They were found, and a part of the ham and potatoes
also. Both got a terrible lashing, enough to take
all the manhood out of them.</p>

<p>When this was told me as their supper was served, I
asked why the men had been punished. They all had
license to do as they pleased. Many dinners had been
taken from the stoves that day in Suwalki. "But not
where <i>die Herrn Offiziere</i> are!" <i>There</i> was the whole
story. <i>We</i> did not exist&mdash;therefore no one could be punished
for what they might do to harm us!</p>

<p>During that supper, it seemed as if all the officers in
Suwalki came to say good-evening. I would hardly get
one samovar emptied and go to the children than they
would ask for another, at the same time expressing sorrow
for my trouble, and saying the officers wished to
meet the American lady,&mdash;and I dared not refuse! It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was possible to avoid giving my hand in greeting because
of the sick child. How miserable to be so torn asunder!
To be kept there with those men when my baby needed
me every minute, but what was there to do? <i>C'est la
Guerre</i>, as all the Germans remarked in exceedingly bad
French. One of the officers who came was evidently a
very great personage. They paid him such deferential
respect. He looked just like an Englishman. I told him
so and he said his mother was an English woman&mdash;seemingly
taking great pleasure in my remark, going on, however,
to say the stain could only be washed from his
blood by the shedding of much English blood! I shivered
to hear the awful things he said; about having
fought since the beginning of the war on the west front
where he had many to his account; how, when the affair
with the Russians was settled, and a peace made, he was
going to England to call on his cousins, with not less than
a hundred lives to the credit of his good sabre! It made
me ill to hear him talk. In their power, one loses the
vision of freedom or right; they filled the horizon; it is
very difficult not to lose courage and hope. I <i>did</i> ask if
there were no one else to take into consideration.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Just God!"</p>

<p>"God stands on the side of the German weapons!"</p>


<p>VI&mdash;CAROUSAL OF SOLDIERS IN HOUSE OF
THE SICK</p>

<p>That night was worse than the first, the forage-wagons
had come! The drinking began. After I had served
many samovars of tea, if you could call it so, half a cup
of rum and a little tea, in and out, in and out from the
children to the table, the officer whose mother's blood he
wished to wash away, had sufficient decency to say I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
tired and should be left undisturbedly with the children.
That second night was as the first, only Stas also
began to rave, talking in that curious dragging, almost
lilting, tone,&mdash;one who has heard does not forget that
dread sign!</p>

<p>Going from one little bed to the other, placing compresses,
wetting the lips so cruelly dry, changing the
sheets,&mdash;while in the next room those men caroused! It
was only God's mercy kept me sane. Afraid to put on a
dressing-gown, I remained as I was.</p>

<p>About five o'clock there was a great rushing about.
Fresh troops were ordered to Augustowo. Many from
our house were leaving. The staff remained, but my acquaintance
of the night before was off. He came at that
hour to wish me good-bye, showing me the picture of his
wife and little daughter, telling me how "brilliantly" the
child was going through the teething process! A gallant
figure he was, mounted on a beautiful horse, as I
looked out of the window, thinking sadly what those new
troops meant.</p>

<p>That morning a Jew came to tell me he had some bread.
By paying him well he gave me quite a quantity. Our
supplies were getting low. The officers' mess had come,
which served them with meat&mdash;but there was still much
for me to provide, and it was only the third day!</p>

<p>The house was much quieter that morning, so that the
sound of the little voices carried into the sitting-room.
Every once in awhile Stas would shriek horribly, frightening
me even more; but as a rule, during the day, they
lay, constantly moving hands and head, talking incessantly,
not recognizing me, and not sleeping. I should
have given them milk, but there was none,&mdash;the only
thing I had was tea or coffee&mdash;both rapidly disappearing.</p>

<p>The weather was very bad, snowing, the icy kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
which hurts one's face; it seemed to fit in with the other
misery.</p>

<p>The officers were gay at dinner. They told me that day
about the amiable project to surround Great Britain with
submarines, that no atom of food might reach her shores.
How in a few days the blockade was to begin, every ship
was to be torpedoed! England through starvation was
to be brought to her knees, the Germans were to be the
lords of the universe, etc., etc. What a picture was
drawn for me! Hard to keep one's balance and think
the other side would also have a word to say in such a
matter, not sitting idly by while the Germans put the
world into their idea of order!</p>

<p>Shortly after dinner they all went away, leaving only
the orderlies, to watch things. The two belonging to the
Captain were very unpleasant. I could not bear them
about, especially Max. Fritz was brutal and stupid&mdash;Max
was cruel and not stupid! About my usual work,
and trying to amuse Wanda girl, we all suddenly stopped
still, breathless at sounds from the street! Wanda cried
out:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mammy, <i>our</i> soldiers have come back&mdash;I hear
their voices."</p>


<p>VII&mdash;STORY OF THE RETURN OF THE
RUSSIANS</p>

<p>Yes, they had come back,&mdash;but how! The street was
full of them, thousands, driven along like dogs, taunted,
beaten, if they fell down, kicked until they either got up
or lay forever still; hungry, exhausted by the long retreat
and the terrible battle. I could have screamed aloud
at what was enacted before my eyes, but there was my
poor little girlie to quiet; she cried so bitterly. I told her
she should carry bread to the Russians. My cook brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the bread cut up in chunks. I told her to go down to the
mounting block with Wanda, thinking surely a little delicate
child would be respected, and the surest means of
getting the bread into the prisoners' hands. It seemed
to me if I could not help some of those men I should go
mad.</p>

<p>Leaving the nurse with my sons, I went to the balcony,
seeing many familiar faces in the company of misery.
When Wanda and the cook reached the block, there was
a wild rush for the bread; trembling hands reached out,
only to be beaten down. One German took a piece from
my little girl's hands, broke off little bits, throwing them
into the air to see those starving men snatch at them and
then hunt in the mud. Finally one Christian among them
gave the cook assistance; the bread was getting to the
men, only we had so little.</p>

<p>Then something so terrible happened that while I live
it can never be blotted from my memory. Wanda&mdash;my
little tender, sensitive child, had a chunk of bread in
her hand, in the act of reaching it to a prisoner, when
Max, the Captain's orderly came up. Taking the bread
from her hand he threw it in the mud, stamping on it!
The poor hungry prisoner with a whimpering cry, stooped
down, wildly searching, when Max raised his foot, and
kicked him violently in the mouth! Wanda screamed:
"Don't hurt Wanda's soldier!" The blood spurted all
over her!</p>

<p>Rushing downstairs I gathered my poor little girlie
into my arms, her whole little body quivering with sobs,
and faced the brute, which had done the deed.</p>

<p>"What religion are you, Max?"</p>

<p>"Roman Catholic."</p>

<p>"Then I hope the Mother of God will not pray for
you when you die, for you have offended one of God's
little ones."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The soldier with bleeding mouth was lying on the side
of the road; my cook tried to help him, but was roughly
driven away.</p>

<p>Carrying Wanda upstairs, trying to still her; heartbroken
myself, what could I tell the little creature? Suddenly
she asked:</p>

<p>"Mammy&mdash;why does God sleep?"</p>

<p>"God is not asleep, darling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then Wanda don't love God when He lets the soldiers
be hurt and kicked!"</p>

<p>"God sees all and loves all&mdash;but the bad man gets into
the hearts of some of His children&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Difficult it was to do anything when I came back into
that room where my little sons lay raving, not to just sit
down and nurse my girlie, six years old, to have seen
such sights! While attending the boys, another scream
from Wanda took me to the window. No wonder she
screamed! The captured guns were being brought into
the town with the Russians <i>hitched</i> to them, driven with
blows through the icy slush of the streets, while <i>the
horses were led along beside them</i>! Wanda cried so
hysterically, that she had to have bromide; the child was
ill. Surely there was nothing worse to come?</p>

<p>The Captain, hearing the sounds and wanting his supper,
came into the room.</p>

<p>"Go away, Captain, if you are a man, and leave me
alone with my babies."</p>

<p>"What is the trouble? Is the little girl ill also?"</p>

<p>"Have you seen what is happening with the Russian
soldiers, taken prisoners?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have seen."</p>

<p>I told him what his orderly, Max, had done. He
slowly, gravely answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, that is bad."</p>

<p>"Where are all those prisoners?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the churches."</p>

<p>Then he said, "Do not show so much sympathy&mdash;it
will only do you harm and help no one. A great man
will be quartered here to-morrow. Do not let him see you
like this; some day when the children are well you will
wish to get away from here."</p>

<p>"But the Russians will have retaken Suwalki long
before that day, and my husband will be here."</p>

<p>"Never, and never, not while there is a German soldier!
Now, be brave and smile, and I will help you as
lays in my power."</p>

<p>But that evening I was not "begged" (?) to serve tea!
What a night it was. My boys were so ill, and I could
not pray that God save them for me. I dare not! God
knows, I had come to a stone wall. It was not even possible
to feel that somewhere my husband was alive. We
were cut off from the living.</p>

<p>(Madame Turczynowicz, in her tales, "When the Prussians
Came to Poland," vividly describes "The Aeroplane
Visits," "The Flight to Warsaw," "Off to Galicia," "Back
to Suwalki," and how she secured her release and freedom,
which finally brought her to America.)</p>

THE GREAT WAR</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the remarkable recital of the adventures of an American
who decided to penetrate the war-ridden countries. Armed with
passports and credentials, with letters of introduction by United
States Senators, and knowledge of secret grips and passwords,
he made a journey which brought him into contact with the
gigantic spy system of Europe. The author, who is one of the
best known educators of the Middle West, has given his experiences
permanent historical record in his book: "My Experiences

I&mdash;STORY OF THE START OF A LONG
JOURNEY</p>

<p>Manifold were the motives that induced me to leave
my home in Boone, a thriving town in Iowa, and undertake
a trip to Europe while the sparks were flying from
the fire of many battlefields. I had no desire to expose
myself to the carnage of war, or to witness the destruction
of men as they fought for the principles which their
country espoused, but rather to pursue in peaceful manner
investigations....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>My 40-horse-power automobile did good service in the
drive of seven blocks on the rainy evening of September
nineteenth, 1915, when I began my trip to the turbulent
scenes of Europe, where the great war, which, since its
beginning in the Balkan states, had been spread as a
cloud of evil over the largest part of the continent.</p>

<p>I confess even now that to me the liabilities of a venture
into Europe at this hazardous time seemed to become
magnified, especially as thoughts of the fate of the
<i>Lusitania</i>, the <i>Arabic</i> and other ships passed through my
mind, but such illusions, as I choose to call them now,
quickly passed away and I soon felt fully assured of utmost
safety even in the war zone.</p>

<p>In my possession I had an official passport to enable
me to conduct my work of study and research in Norway,
Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, issued by authority
of the United States Government, which, in order
to become valid in the belligerent countries, required the
visa of a consular officer of each of the countries which
were at war and which I necessarily must enter to conduct
my investigations. With this document in regular
form, I felt that my security was absolute, so long as I
traveled on a ship of a neutral country, such as steamship
<i>Frederick VIII</i>, which carried the flag of Denmark.
These conditions well guarded, I left home and friends
with pleasant anticipations of an interesting trip across
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>As I was about to board the Pullman car, I noticed
one of the leading suffragettes of the community among
those who had gathered on the platform. She was coming
toward me with the winsome smile that only a veteran
in the battalion of a suffragette campaign can wear, and
I felt rather pleased than disappointed to have her among
those who were to wish me a pleasant journey and a
safe return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put a few bullets into the kaiser for me while you
are in Europe" were the words with which this apostle
of equal rights greeted me as I felt her hand taking
mine. "Well," said I earnestly, "I am an American and
am going to Europe to study, to explore, not to fight. If
it were possible, and, if the life of the kaiser were at
stake, I would put forth an effort to save it as quickly as
I would, to the extent of my ability, protect the life of
the king of England or the President of the United
States. I believe it to be the duty of an American, when
he is abroad, to so conduct himself that he will be a
credit and honor to his country. This duty compels me
to preserve absolute neutrality in relation to the belligerent
nations instead of&mdash;" At this point she began speaking
and I cannot recall all she said, but her parting words,
which she intended to be friendly, were these: "If that
is the way you feel about it, if you are not going to help
overthrow the kaiser, I do not care what happens to
you."</p>

<p>Having dispatched general business matters, my final
object in Chicago was to have my passport visaed so as
to admit me to the warring countries of Europe. However,
this was merely a matter of form, as the personal
letters which I carried from Senator Cummins, Congressman
Woods, Governor Clarke, Senator Kenyon, Professor
Bell and many other men prominent in politics and in
education were sufficient to make the introduction ample
and effective.</p>


<p>II&mdash;MYSTERIOUS STRANGERS ON THE
PULLMAN TRAIN</p>

<p>The train was speeding swiftly when breakfast was
announced in the diner.... My eyes surveyed the passengers
with more than ordinary interest, not that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
looking for a familiar face, but because I was attracted
by the appearance of several gentlemen who gave the impression
that they were not Americans.... It was my
conclusion that the faces in which I was interested included
those of one Englishman, one German and two
Frenchmen. They seemed to avoid conversation with
each other, both here and later in the Pullman cars, and
I began to think of them as secret agents who were operating
in connection with the business end of the war in
Europe.</p>

<p>At the first call for lunch I again made my way to the
diner and noticed that the gentleman whom I had suspected
of being an Englishman was seated at a small
table by himself. This appeared to be my opportunity
to study him more closely and I took the seat left unoccupied
at the same table, facing him squarely, and
began a conversation about the weather and other topics
which usually are uppermost in the semi-vacant mind.
My first effort secured the information that he had
boarded the train at Niagara Falls and was ticketed for
New York, where he had very important business not
entirely of a personal nature. His conversation was
guarded and considerate, while mine began to appear
evasive; at least this is my estimate of the diplomacy we
were practising.</p>

<p>Several years before I had been told by a court-joker,
of which there are many in Europe, that the name of
Hanson is borne by one-third of the people of Denmark
and that the remainder of the populace in that country
is largely of the Holst, Peters and Larsen families. Now,
under these circumstances, if I would gain the confidence
of this fellow traveler, I could not reveal my real identity,
but, instead, must choose one or more of the methods
of concealment which are so common in detective
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I take you to be an Englishman, or at least an English
subject," said I, after a pause.</p>

<p>He smiled knowingly and answered affirmatively, saying,
"Your guess is correct in both particulars."</p>

<p>"Well," I continued, "I was born English, that is, I
hail from the Australian state of Victoria, near the city
of Hamilton, where my father settled on land nearly seventy
years ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed," said he, "then you must know much of
Ballarat and Melbourne and Geelong, where I have been
often."</p>

<p>After this our conversation was easy and covered a
wide range of topics. Luckily we did not occupy seats
in the same Pullman car, hence we agreed to meet at
Albany and take dinner together on the run from that
city to New York. I indicate that it was fortunate that
we did not occupy seats in the same car, and I found it
so, because it gave me an opportunity to plan a line of
conversation for the evening ride.</p>


<p>III&mdash;THE "SIGN OF SILENCE"&mdash;THE SPY'S
PASSPORT</p>

<p>At Albany all passengers for New York were required
to change cars and it was necessary to wait a brief time
to make connections. On the platform I met my new
acquaintance, who had made himself known to me as
John Fenwick of Adelaide, Australia, and here he was
in earnest conversation with two young men. These he
introduced to me as George Fenton and James Barton,
the former a stout man with blue eyes and auburn hair
and the latter a tall individual with keen, dark eyes and
slightly gray hair.</p>

<p>In greeting them I took the right hand in mine and
pressed the last joint of the small finger between my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
thumb and second finger of my right hand. Then I
opened the back cover of my watch and inside of it exposed
the <i>Sign of Silence</i>, saying, "This is the safe side."
They answered, each for himself, "I notice."</p>

<p>Having made the impression that I had knowledge of
this order of secret agents and their manner of identification,
I won their confidence. This way of winning
them to trust me I had learned in Chicago several weeks
before, where I met a number of large buyers of horses,
who confided in me because I knew much of the horse
market and the shipment of horses from Iowa.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Fenwick and his companions looked upon
me as one of their class of people, I was far from it and
entered upon a study of this line of operations as an interesting
adjunct of the great war in Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>The trio of spies, as I choose to call them now, hailed
with satisfaction the intelligence that I had been in Iowa,
where I had made observations of the purchase and shipment
of horses for the Allies, especially England and
France. These shipments included several thousand animals.</p>

<p>This information was correct, as I had seen many carloads
of horses unloaded for feeding at Boone, Valley
Junction and other railway divisions in the Mississippi
valley, later to be reloaded and forwarded to points east
and eventually to Europe. I had also seen many horses
that had been bought in the vicinity of Boone for the
entente Allies and had examined them in the yards before
shipment.</p>

<p>The western farming and ranching country, especially
the Mississippi Valley, was covered by agents buying
draft and army horses. Hundreds of posters were scattered
throughout the stock-raising districts, among mule
and horse raisers, and many newspapers carried display
advertising in their columns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>They secured the impression that I was on my way to
Europe for the purpose of looking more closely into the
stock market in Denmark, where Germany had purchased
quite heavily at the beginning of the war. As all this
caused them to speak more freely, I evaded a discussion
of my mission to Denmark, but told them I was ticketed
for Copenhagen and that I expected to make the Hotel
Central, on Raadhuspladsen, my headquarters. This induced
them to have even greater confidence in me than
before, as strangers usually give the mailing address at
general delivery in the post-office, instead of divulging
their place of abode.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;AROUND THE TABLE WITH THE
SECRET AGENTS</p>

<p>Soon after the train left Albany, I joined the trio in
the dining car and, fortunately, we secured a table by
ourselves. This was to be the farewell dinner of four
who had widely diverging routes and vastly different purposes
before them. Mr. Fenwick was to sail to Liverpool,
Mr. Fenton and Mr. Barton were <i>en route</i> to the
South and West, and I, as stated in a former chapter,
was bound for Copenhagen. How wonderful it would
be if we could meet two months later to compare the experiences
and achievements of each traveler with that of
the others!</p>

<p>The effect of my feint was that I was invited to meet
with them at Hotel Belmont in New York, where they
had planned a consultation. This invitation I accepted
and agreed to be there as soon as possible after I would
reach the city, not later than eight o'clock.</p>

<p>After a short visit in the lobby of the hotel, we repaired
for a light luncheon to a café in the vicinity, where
a private dining room had been reserved for us and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
which refreshments, including cigars and several bottles
of champagne, had been brought. It was not long until
we got down to "merriment and business," as Mr. Fenwick
called the proceedings.</p>

<p>Unfortunate in good fellowship is he who attends such
a meeting, if he has not learned to smoke and to imbibe
the nectar of Bacchus, but this was my plight in the council
which had assembled to promote or influence the labors
of Mars. However, I was excused good-naturedly on the
ground that, as I was to sail on the morrow, such indulgence
would unsettle me as a sailor.</p>

<p>Between jokes and drinks, both of which came fast,
but of which the latter came the faster, the discussion
turned almost entirely to the project of starving Germany
and her allies into submission.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Barton, after emptying a fair-sized
glass of champagne and blowing a cloud of tobacco smoke
across the room, "I think the best dope is to keep the
Yankees thinking the Germans are about to invade New
York with an army of a million men, supported by a fleet
of fifty superdreadnaughts. This will keep them discussing
what they call 'preparedness for defense' while England
is destroying neutral trade between America and
Europe."</p>

<p>Having made what he considered a capital speech, Mr.
Fenwick blinked his eyes and lilted in an unusually cheerful
tone the rag-time he had hummed several times before:</p>

<div class="poem">
"Ah'l lend yo' ma hat!<br />
Ah'l lend yo' ma flat!<br />
Ah'l lend yo' ma lovely overcoat of fur!<br />
Ah'l lend yo' everyt'ing Ah've got&mdash;excep' ma wife!<br />
An' Ah'l mak' yo' <i>a present of</i> HER!"<br />
</div>

<p>The trio laughed merrily and smacked their lips as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
they sipped the champagne drawn from a bottle with a
long, slender neck. Mr. Fenton held his glass near his
chin and smiled approvingly, shouting, "That is the spirit
of genuine liberality."</p>

<p>To me his smile appeared bland and harmless, but the
impression he made, as he moved the glass up and down,
was sinister and betrayed covert evil and danger. I
began to feel uneasy and uncertain of the situation. This
was the first experience of the kind I had ever witnessed.</p>

<p>Instead of studying me and my motives and purposes,
these men became anxious to tell me of their experiences
in the past and what they had set out to accomplish in
the future. Instead of being a plastic organism in their
hands, to be formed into shape and used to accomplish
their desires as they had intended, they were divulging
to me what I wanted to know of them in particular and
the work of secret agents in general.</p>

<p>The school in which I had suddenly become a student
was interesting beyond my power to describe. They
howled and roared like raving beasts that are seeking
to devour each other. My eyes and ears were open every
moment, permitting nothing to escape, while I said only
sufficient to keep the trio busy in their eagerness to surpass
each other in relating the smart stories with which
detectives are familiar. In this manner I easily accomplished
my purpose, that is, I learned much of the work
and methods of secret agents in America and received the
information which enabled me to find their compatriots
in Europe.</p>

<p>At this juncture I also learned that Mr. Fenwick was
ultimately to locate in Holland, where he was to join
other secret service men in keeping a close watch of the
movements of goods imported with the consent of Great
Britain from North and South America. He was to ascertain
whether any of these goods were finding their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
way into Germany, and, if so, in what quantity and under
what conditions.</p>

<p>By this time we had finished our luncheon.</p>

<p>I was ready to leave the table and planned to do so as
gracefully as possible. All I still wanted was some information
about the confederates of Mr. Fenwick in Denmark.
This was not difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>These spies, or secret service men as they called themselves,
had the impression that I was in the same line of
work as Mr. Fenwick, except that I was to operate in
Denmark. For this reason they gave me much information
about commercial affairs which were not open for
publication and supplied me with addresses of people in
Denmark in whom I could confide. The session came to
a close at about ten o'clock, after which I hurried to the
place of my residence near the Battery, where I had engaged
quarters.</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORY OF A SEA VOYAGE FROM NEW
YORK TO CHRISTIANA</p>

<p>Before leaving New York I mailed several letters and
many American newspapers to the Danish capital, addressing
them in care of Hoved Post Kontor, Kopenhagen,
Denmark. The letters had been given to me by Mr.
Fenwick for identification among some people he knew
and they later proved of much value to me in conducting
my study of the work of spies and its effect upon commerce
and the trend of the war. My purpose in mailing
the letters and newspapers was to evade the possibility of
losing them in case of detention and seizure of the ship
before reaching the capital of Denmark, which was not
entirely out of the range of probability.</p>

<p>The ocean-liner <i>Frederick VIII</i> was throbbing under
the pressure of superheated steam when I arrived at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
docks in Hoboken, shortly before two o'clock in the afternoon
of September twenty-second. Everything was ready
for her to put to sea in the long route across the northern
part of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>At the table to which the chief steward assigned me
were one Danish officer of the steamship and seven passengers.
The latter included one English, one German,
two Belgian and three American citizens. The general
conversation was in German, and this was pleasing to
me, as it gave me an opportunity to cultivate the use of
the Teutonic tongue with much effect.</p>

<p>Among the passengers was Mr. Niels Petersen, who
had been in Canada and had taken pictures at the principal
seaports, such as St. John, Halifax, Quebec and Montreal.
His photographs included views of harbors,
bridges, railway terminals, stretches of highways and
prominent buildings. He had been tracked to New York,
where he was detected by British spies, and a telegram
to Kirkwall by way of London demanded his arrest on
the charge that he was guilty of espionage.</p>

<p>This party declared his innocence and claimed to be a
Dane. He admitted having the photographs, but said
they were taken for his personal study and for no other
purpose. On the seventh day at Kirkwall he was taken
from the ship as a spy and removed in a small boat. At
the time of his arrest he was singing a patriotic song of
Denmark, verses of which he continued singing as he was
removed, and while taken away he waved his hand in
farewell to the steamship that had carried him into the
hands of his accusers. This was the last seen of him by
the passengers; it is said he was taken to a detention camp
and later imprisoned.</p>

<p>At Christiana British trade spies were numerous at
the railway stations and in the vicinity of the docks. I
saw them at restaurants and in the lobbies of the leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
hotels, especially at the Grand, the Scandinavie, and
the Continental. It was not difficult to identify myself
by using the <i>Sign of Silence</i>, which I had employed successfully
at Albany, when the two companions of Mr.
Fenwick were introduced to me. My knowledge of the
purchase of horses, grain, cotton and meat by the allies
in America interested them.</p>

<p>These spies were studying the register at the leading
hotels so they might know the class of strangers who
were in the city, whether German, Russian, French, etc.,
and the effect which the propaganda of these or any of
them had upon public thought in Norway.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;WITH THE SPIES IN SWEDEN</p>

<p>From Christiana I went to Trondhjem and later to
Hell, both seaports on fjords with deep harbors. At
both these places I found spies of the allies on the same
mission as those at Christiana, but in addition also
agents friendly to Russia who were counteracting the
rising feeling against the czar and his alleged desire to
annex northern Sweden and Norway, to secure an outlet
through an open port on the Atlantic.</p>

<p>On my second day at Trondhjem, shortly after leaving
the Grand Hotel, I met Mr. Solomon Lankelinsky, a
Hebrew merchant, from whom I learned much of the
Russian agents who were working to influence sentiment.
In fact I had met many Jews and all with whom I came
in contact expressed themselves anti-Russian.</p>

<p>At this time the campaign at the Dardanelles was in
full swing, which the czar expected would be forced by
the British and French, after which Constantinople would
be captured and the whole region annexed to Russia to
connect her commercially with the Mediterranean. Several
secret agents of Russia I met here and at Hell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
made this solution in the near East the theme of conversation
and promulgated discussion by publishing articles
regarding it in the newspapers. It appeared singular that
these secret agents, although acting for Russia, conversed
almost entirely in the German language, which tongue is
spoken extensively in Warsaw and many large cities of
Russia.</p>

<p>In the Swedish capital, the city of Stockholm, the
secret service men likewise were abundant. They were
active in the lobbies of the Grand, the Continental and
the Central hotels. I met them in the city and in the
suburbs, everywhere busy as bees. Here the work of
spies was not so much concerned with commerce as with
the study and direction of public sentiment, for which
purpose they wrote for newspapers both in Sweden and
in their own countries.</p>

<p>This was before the movement for conscription had
made much progress in England, and the British were
endeavoring in vain to induce men to join the army.
One of the English secret agents showed me a poster that
was being used to enlist the support of the women, thinking
they would lend a hand to induce their husbands, sons
or sweethearts to go to war.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;STORY OF A RUSSIAN MADAM ON
SECRET SERVICE</p>

<p>On the eighteenth of October I ticketed for Malmö
by way of Nörrkoping, taking the train from the central
station. The seat opposite mine in the well-cushioned
compartment was occupied by a lady of middle age. She
kept her suit case near her seat as if she feared it might
become lost.</p>

<p>Little was said at the beginning of the trip. She took
observations through the window of the compartment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
especially of the outlying districts of the city, a part of
which is known as Gamle Stockholm, and seemed interested
in the fields, gardens and forests.</p>

<p>I busied myself reading in a guide of Sweden. At
length we began a conversation. She tried to convey the
idea that she spoke no language but Swedish, but I soon
discovered her accent to be that of a Slav and that she
was able to converse freely in German.</p>

<p>Pointing my finger at her, I said, "You are a Russian
spy and the evidence is in your suit case."</p>

<p>To me it seemed that her face displayed all the colors
of the rainbow. She threw up her hands excitedly, moving
them up and down like a country pedlar.</p>

<p>"Sir," she said at length, "you surprise me, you offend
my loyalty. Why accuse me for no other reason than
that I am a Russian?"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, madam," I replied. "Although I am
an American, I know of your work and have you noted
in a list of people who are practicing espionage. However,
you need not fear me in the least. I am neutral and
am interested in you only as a matter of general information."</p>

<p>Then I showed her my American passport and many
letters of identification, in which manner she was led to
confide in me. My guess had proven a correct one.</p>

<p>She gave her name as Miss Michailowitsch and showed
me some letters to bear out her statement. The work
she was doing consisted of coöperating with others in
watching Finland, where the men of military age had
become restive and many were emigrating. It was her
special business to observe these people and, if possible,
learn who and how many were joining the German army
in Poland and on the Dvinsk River.</p>

<p>I left the train at Nörrkoping while Miss Michailowitsch
went on to Malmö. At the time of leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
train, I advised her to change her occupation, if she
valued her life. This admonition elicited a bland smile.</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;SPIES OF DENMARK&mdash;COPENHAGEN
THE MECCA OF SPIES</p>

<p>The steamer ran into port at Havnegade, which is the
landing place for the vessels crossing the Sound, and I
made haste to Hotel Central, on Raadhuspladsen. At
this hotel and at general postal delivery I expected mail
from America and from secret agents I had met at New
York and at various places in Europe. The mailman
was liberal and gave me many letters and packages, small
and large, which reminded me of an American mail
order house. Had I been in a country at war, where
strangers were carefully watched, I would have been
under no mild suspicion.</p>

<p>The first evening, after a hasty meal, I made a trip to
the leading hotels, including the Bristol, the Cosmopolite,
the Dagmar, the Palads, the Monopol and the Grand
Hotel National. By this initial but rapid tour it was
possible to locate the places where strangers gather and
to feel the pulse of commerce and public sentiment. My
first impression was right: "Copenhagen is at present the
Babel of travel and the Mecca of European secret service
work."</p>

<p>When I was about to retire for the night, while on my
way back to the hotel, I met a man who wanted to sell
me a lead pencil. I purchased, but at the same time
studied the expression of his face, which seemed to tell
a story of a different life than that of the street vendor.
He limped while stepping on his right foot and carried a
rather elegant looking cane.</p>

<p>On Raadhuspladsen I met several men who were taking
pictures for travelers. They were agreeable looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
fellows and I engaged them to take several views of me,
including one of the monument known as <i>Death and
Sorrow</i> which is a fine bronze piece near the Hellig
Aand Church. It was not long until I made the discovery
that these men were spies. Indeed, I found spies
disguised as street vendors, newspaper sellers, bootblacks,
interpreters, guides and as workers in many other common
callings. At the Bristol Hotel I met several spies to
whom Mr. Fenwick had referred me while I was in New
York. They gave spice to my leisure moments and
stimulated interest in the war.</p>

<p>After I had been in Copenhagen several days, late in
the afternoon, I decided to go to the docks and shipping
yards to take observations of the freight which was moving
through the city. Here I discovered a man making
notations of cars which were either loading or unloading.
These cars were from the continent and were marked
from different places, such as Bromberg, Dresden, Munich,
Bautzen and other cities of Germany.</p>

<p>Here was the clue that Denmark was trading extensively
with the Central Powers. This spy was listing
the cars and steamships engaged in this trade; he was
taking the names of the ships and cars and making a
record of the commodities in which trading was done.
After observing his work for some time, I made my presence
known and found him to be the street vendor from
whom I had purchased a lead pencil on my first evening
in the city, but he was now posing as a railroad official
and held his cane before him as he walked rapidly away.</p>

<p>It did not require much time for the street vendor,
who pretended to be lame as he leaned upon his cane, to
dent the crown of his hat and assume the more important
attitude of a railway and steamboat inspector. He
may have deceived others a long time, but I was on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
trail and discovered his smart delusion much sooner than
he expected.</p>

<p>Several times I invited a number of the spies that I
met at the Bristol Hotel to accompany me to entertainments,
including a certain John Denton, a friend of Mr.
Fenwick, who went with me to the Scala Theater, where
a comic opera known as <i>Polsk Blod</i> was presented. This
gentleman entertained much and came in contact with
many prominent Danes.</p>

<p>I gave him the letter written by Mr. Fenwick at New
York, but not before I made a copy of it, thinking this
precaution would serve my purpose to an advantage elsewhere.
Later, when I returned to New York, I secured
stationery and had duplicate copies written on letterheads
of Hotel Belmont.</p>


<p>IX&mdash;THROUGH CORDONS OF SPIES TO
BERLIN</p>

<p>After some time of interesting visits and conversations,
I left Copenhagen to go partly by train and partly by
steamer to Berlin, making the trip to Germany by way of
Warnemünde. This is the port on the Baltic Sea through
which the German capital and the interior of Europe may
be reached most conveniently.</p>

<p>I had not been in Germany many days until I learned
from personal observation that some travelers I met professed
friendship for Germany and in spite of their professions
were false and dangerous enemies. To me it
seemed, in view of this fact, that the authorities leaned
rather on the side of leniency than on the side of severity.
In all public places was the notice:</p>

<div class="center">
SOLDATEN<br />
VORSICHT IN GESPRACHEN<br />
SPIONENGEFAHR<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The translation is as follows: Soldiers, careful in
conversations; danger of spies!</p>

<p>That there was an invasion of spies and secret service
men, mostly representing England and France, I learned
soon after I reached the large cities of Germany. They
were disguised in various ways, as laborers, students and
professional and business men.</p>

<p>I had been in Berlin more than three weeks, had consulted
with the American ambassador, Hon. James W.
Gerard; with Mr. James O'Donnell Bennett and Mr.
Robert J. Thompson, American newspaper reporters;
with members of the German parliament, and many officials
in civic and military positions, including Herr Gottlieb
von Jagow, the German secretary of foreign affairs,
before I obtained privileges to visit prison camps, border
fortifications and fields in the east where action had destroyed
cities and devastated the country.</p>

<p>After I had traveled to inspect the points which I
wanted to visit, I began to plan to learn from first hand
experience the strange and horrible action and destruction
in war. It was my purpose to meet those who had fought
at the front and had been in the thick of the fight at noted
engagements. In this manner I obtained information by
personal inspection and at the same time saw safely by
proxy what would otherwise be dangerous and impossible.</p>


<p>X&mdash;"THE SPY I MET IN WARSAW"</p>

<p>The shortest trip from Berlin to Warsaw is by way of
Bromberg and Thorn, but I chose the route going through
Breslau-Oppeln-Czestochowa, the last mentioned town
being in Russia, which takes the traveler through Skierniewice
and enters Warsaw from the south-west. In returning,
I chose the route Skierniewice-Alexandrowa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
which, in Germany, is the line Thorn-Bromberg-Schneidemühle-Berlin.</p>

<p>This route permits the traveler to see much of the
farming districts in eastern Germany and a large part of
Poland, which, by the way, is no mean ambition in the
time of war. Here as nowhere else is exemplified the
great faith the Germans had in the soil as a mainstay of
success. They had gone into partnership with nature to
work out their salvation.</p>

<p>My entrance into the Polish capital was without formality.
I went at once to Hotel Rom, where I left my
hand baggage, and then reported at the police station.
The fact that I had announced myself as a literary writer
(Schriftsteller) seemed to entitle me to more than ordinary
courtesies.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of my first day in the city, while near
the main building of the university, I met a young man
who was walking leisurely. He was holding a cane and
was resting his chin upon his right hand.</p>

<p>Not long afterward, in an angular street near by, I
saw a person who reminded me of the young man I had
met shortly before. His pants seemed to be made of the
same kind of woolen goods, but his hat and coat appeared
different.</p>

<p>The following day I met the same person and took the
liberty to speak to him. In the course of time I learned
that he was a secret service man and had been detailed
to watch a number of strangers who were sojourning in
the city. Those who were under surveillance, I learned
soon after, included me as well as several guests at Hotel
Rom.</p>

<p>This young man had a coat with two sides suitable
for outside wear. When one was exposed, he looked
like a student, and in the other he had the appearance
of a newspaper seller. He was one of many secret service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
men in civilian clothes who were doing police duty and
detective work.</p>


<p>XI&mdash;STORY OF THE DAINTY SPY AT
BERLIN</p>

<p>When I returned to Berlin from the east, I engaged
quarters at Pension Stern, a pleasant place on Unter den
Linden. The outlook from the front window enabled
me to see all that famous thoroughfare, from the statue
of Frederick the Great to the Brandenburger Tor. The
panorama included the vacant French embassy, the Cafe
Victoria, the main building of the University of Berlin
and the Dom Kirche in the distance.</p>

<p>I had returned to the capital city to visit the museums,
art galleries and palaces of Berlin as well as the suburbs
of Spandau, Charlottenburg and Potsdam. It was my
purpose to study life at the capital as well as to see the
military side of the war in the German metropolis, including
the great prison camp at Döberitz.</p>

<p>At the reading rooms of the <i>Chicago Daily News</i>, on
Unter den Linden, I found many American and English
periodicals and went there frequently to peruse them.
Several times I met at this place a dainty lady who spoke
German like a Bavarian and English with the (ze) accent
of a Parisian. This lady I learned to know as Miss
Julia Bross and I put her on my list of possible spies.</p>

<p>She accepted pleasantly my invitation to take dinner
at Cafe Victoria, where she drank coffee and smoked a
cigarette while I labored over a cup of tea as a final
course in a long list of eatables. Her home was in Denmark,
which was evidenced by numerous letters which
she carried, and she was in the city to teach French and
study German.</p>

<p>The story of the dainty dame was well planned, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
I doubted her. She was a spy and was on dangerous
footing. With apologies to Bret Harte, I wrote in my
diary:</p>

<div class="poem">
That for ways that are dark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And for tricks that are vain</span><br />
The female spy is peculiar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which the same I would rise to explain.</span><br />
</div>

<p>The city was full of soldiers,&mdash;at churches, in theaters,
at restaurants, on the streets, in short, everywhere were
soldiers. Life was no departure from the usual. The
shops were full of goods and everybody was doing business
in the even tenor of his way. The sound of martial
music, the marching of soldiers and the flutter of many
German, Bulgarian, Turkish and Austria-Hungarian
flags in public places were the only reminders that war
was in progress.</p>

<p>On a train of the Stadtbahn (city railway) I went to
Döberitz, where I made a complete tour of the military
camp, including the prison yards, the military drill
grounds and the field of aviation. The clear sky was
dotted with many flying machines, including <i>taubes</i>, biplanes
and Zeppelins, making the district buzz with their
rapid-working machinery.</p>

<p>Toward evening I wended my way from the prison
yards to the depot, about a half mile, walking slowly over
the sandy tract. When I arrived at the station I was
surprised to find that Miss Bross was among the passengers
who were waiting to return to the city.</p>

<p>Miss Bross had reached the place by a different train
than the one by which I came. She had been busy in the
sunlight, she said, enjoying the open sky and the warm,
autumnal breezes.</p>

<p>To me her mission to Döberitz appeared very different.
It seemed that she had no interest in the prison camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that to her the sanitation and employment of prisoners
was a blank book, but everything I mentioned about the
drill of soldiers and the maneuvers of flying machines
aroused her interest. To the one she was blind and to
the others she was wide awake and far-seeing. The difference
in her feeling on these topics deepened my suspicion
that she was practicing a clever game of espionage.</p>

<p>I had taken a seat beside her on a bench in the railway
station and began to study her face. She was alert and
cunning, but her attitude was vague and evasive.</p>

<p>When the express train rolled into the station, I was
ready to board it without delay. The evening was pleasant
and the train moved rapidly toward the metropolis.
Miss Bross alighted at Potsdamer Platz, while I went as
far as Friedrich Strasse.</p>

<p>Several times I met Miss Bross at the reading rooms of
the <i>Chicago Daily News</i>, where she observed the news
columns and editorials of the German-American newspapers
with special interest. Near the last of November
she told me she had decided to go home to Denmark on
the third of December. By this time I had purchased
passage to New York and left for Copenhagen the same
morning.</p>

<p>After luncheon on the railway diner, Miss Bross
seemed worried about the examination at Warnemünde,
where German officers inspected the baggage and person
of the passengers. This examination, owing to much
espionage, had been greatly intensified.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the case of Miss Edith Cavell?"
she asked, "I mean the nurse who was executed as a spy
in Belgium by the Germans."</p>

<p>"This case," I answered, "is an unusual one. Miss
Cavell had the utmost confidence of the German officers,
who granted her extraordinary privileges as a nurse,
while she busied herself most of the time organizing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
band of spies to operate against the German army in
France."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true; but she was a woman who had done
some good and her life should have been spared. At least
they think so in France and England where funds are
being raised to build monuments to her memory."</p>


<p>XII&mdash;THE "SCRAP OF PAPER"&mdash;A DEATH
WARRANT</p>

<p>The train was entering the station at Warnemünde.
Miss Bross seemed nervous. She handed me a small
scrap of paper, saying, "If I am on the train after we
leave Warnemünde, hand it back to me; otherwise do
what you like with it."</p>

<p>It was currently reported that all the passengers when
entering or leaving a country at war, in Germany as well
as in France and England, would be required to remove
all their clothes and undergo a thorough examination.
This proved to be the case in this instance, except where
travelers could make an unusually good showing of neutrality
and fairness, under which condition I passed the
scrutinizing officers to my utmost satisfaction.</p>

<p>When the steamship was crossing the Baltic Sea, I
looked in vain among the passengers for Miss Bross, who,
according to subsequent reports, was retained as a spy.
The examining officer, a German lady, had found a plat
of the military grounds at Spandau pasted to the sole of
her bare foot. I never saw her again.</p>

<p>This gave me the liberty to do as I pleased with the
scrap of paper Miss Bross handed to me on the train.
On examination I found it embodied a somewhat faulty
plat of the military camp at Döberitz.</p>

<p>It occurred to me immediately that I had assumed a
dangerous and unnecessary risk in permitting her to place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
it in my custody. Had I known the contents of this
innocent looking scrap of paper, it would have been
utterly impossible to have induced me to even touch it.
However, the matter ended without injury to me, and I
was extremely glad that I was sailing on the Baltic Sea,
instead of being at the inspection rooms at Warnemünde
with the scrap of paper in my pocket.</p>

KAISER'S ARMADA</h2></div>

<p><i>Hunting the Seas on a German Submarine</i></p>

<p><i>By Baron Spiegel Von Und Zu Peckelsheim, Captain
Lieutenant Commander of the U-202</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is a thrilling day by day story of the daring, hunting raid
of a German submarine, told by the officer in charge. He tells
how the undersea boat is maneuvered; how the English and
French attempt to guard the channel against the enemy's deadly
U-boats. He reveals the emotions of the officers and crew of
the little 202 in the presence of what seemed death the next
moment, and tells of their marvellous achievements in the midst
of their sinister tasks. This is one of the most astounding
personal narratives that the War has yielded. These selections

I&mdash;STORY OF THE SUBMARINE CAPTAIN</p>

<p>What peculiar sensations filled me. We were at war&mdash;the
most insane war ever fought! And now I am a
commander on a U-boat!</p>

<p>I said to myself:</p>

<p>"You submarine, you undersea boat, you faithful
U-202, which has obediently and faithfully carried me
thousands of miles and will still carry me many thousand
miles! I am a commander of a submarine which
scatters death and destruction in the ranks of the enemy,
which carries death and hell fire in its bosom, and which
rushes through the water like a thoroughbred. What am
I searching for in the cold, dark night? Do I think about
honor and success? Why does my eye stare so steadily
into the dark? Am I thinking about death and the innumerable
mines which are floating away off there in
the dark, am I thinking about enemy scouts which are
seeking me?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>"No! It is nerves and foolish sentiments born of
foolish spirits. I am not thinking about that. Leave me
alone and don't bother me. I am the master. It is the
duty of my nerves to obey. Can you hear the melodious
song from below, you weakling nerves? Are you so
dull and faint-hearted that it does not echo within you?
Do you not know the stimulating power which the thin
metal voice below can inspire within you?</p>

<p>"This song brings greetings to you from a distance of
twelve hundred miles and through twelve hundred miles
it comes to you. Ahead we must look; we must force
our eyes to pierce the darkness on all sides."</p>

<p>The spy-glass flew to the eye. There is a flash in
the west. A light!</p>

<p>"Hey, there! Hey! There is something over
there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is no ordinary light. What about it?"</p>


<p>II&mdash;NIGHT ON THE OCEAN&mdash;ON DECK OF A
SUBMARINE</p>

<p>Lieutenant Petersen was looking through his night
glasses at the light.</p>

<p>"I believe he is signaling," he said excitedly. "The
light flashes continually to and fro. I hope it is not a
scout ship trying to speak with some one."</p>

<p>Hardly had the lieutenant uttered these words when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
we all three jumped as if electrified, because certainly in
our immediate neighborhood flashed before us several
quick lights giving signals, which undoubtedly came from
the ship second in line, which was signaling to our first
friend.</p>

<p>"Great God! An enemy ship! Not more than three
hundred meters ahead!" I exclaimed to myself.</p>

<p>"Hard a starboard! Both engines at highest speed
ahead! To the diving stations!"</p>

<p>In a subdued voice, I called my commands down the
tower.</p>

<p>The phonograph in the crew-room stopped abruptly.
A hasty, eager running was discernible through the entire
boat as each one hurried to his post.</p>

<p>The boat immediately obeyed the rudder and was flying
to starboard. Between the two hostile ships there
was a continuous exchange of signals.</p>

<p>"God be praised it is so dark!" I exclaimed with a deep
breath as soon as the first danger had passed.</p>

<p>"And to think that the fellow had to betray his presence
by his chattering signals just as we were about to
run right into his arms," was the answer. "This time we
can truly say that the good God, Himself, had charge
of the rudder."</p>

<p>The engineer appeared on the stairway which leads
from the "Centrale" up to the conning tower.</p>

<p>"May I go to the engine-room, Herr Captain-Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>It was not permissible for him to leave his diving station,
the "Centrale," which is situated in the center of
the boat, without special permission.</p>

<p>"Yes, Herr Engineer, go ahead down and fire up
hard!" I replied.</p>

<p>The thumping of the heavy oil-motors became stronger,
swelled higher and higher, and, at last, became a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
drawn out roar, and entirely drowned the sound of the
occasional jolts which always were distinctly discernible
when going at slower speed. One truly felt how the boat
exerted its strength to the utmost and did everything
within its power.</p>

<p>We had put ourselves on another course which put the
anxiously signaling Britishers obliquely aport of our
stern, and rushed with the highest speed for about ten
minutes until their lights became smaller and weaker.
We then turned point by point into our former course,
and thus slipped by in a large half circle around the hostile
ships.</p>

<p>"Just as a cat around a bowl of hot oatmeal," said
Lieutenant Petersen.</p>

<p>"No, my dear friend," I said laughingly, "it does not
entirely coincide. The cat always comes back, but the
oatmeal is too hot for us in this case. Or do you think
that I intend to circle around those two rascals for
hours?"</p>

<p>"Preferably not, Herr Captain-Lieutenant. It could
end badly!"</p>

<p>"Both engines in highest speed forward, let the crew
leave the diving stations, place the guards!" I ordered.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was three minutes after six o'clock, and within about
half an hour the sun would rise, but the sea and the sky
still floated together in the colorless drab of early dawn
and permitted one only to imagine, not see, that partition
wall, the horizon.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>Unceasingly our binoculars pierced the gray dusk of
daybreak. Suddenly a shiver went through my body
when&mdash;only a second immovable and in intense suspense&mdash;a
dark shadow within range of the spy-glass made me
jump. The shadow grew and became larger, like a giant
on the horizon&mdash;one mast; one, two, three, four funnels&mdash;a
destroyer.</p>

<p>A quick command&mdash;I leap down into the tower. The
water rushes into the diving tanks. The conning tower
covers slam tight behind me&mdash;and the agony which follows
tries our patience, while we count seconds with
watches in hand until the tanks are filled, and the boat
slips below the sea.</p>

<p>Never in my life did a second seem so long to me. The
destroyer, which is not more than two thousand meters
distant from us, has, of course, seen us, and is speeding
for us as fast as her forty thousand horse power can
drive her. From the guns mounted on her bow flash
one shot after another aimed to destroy us.</p>

<p>Good God! If he only does not hit! Just one little
hit, and we are lost! Already the water splashes on the
outside of the conning tower up to the glass windows
through which I see the dark ghost, streaking straight for
us. It is terrifying to hear the shells bursting all around
us in the water. It sounds like a triphammer against a
steel plate, and closer and closer come the metallic
crashes. The rascal is getting our range.</p>

<p>There&mdash;the fifth shot&mdash;the entire boat trembles&mdash;then
the deceitful daylight disappears from the conning-tower
window. The boat obeys the diving rudder and submerges
into the sea.</p>

<p>A reddish-yellow light shines all around us; the indicator
of the manometer, which measures our depth, points
to eight meters, nine meters, ten meters, twelve meters.
Saved!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<p>III&mdash;HOW IT FEELS TO PLUNGE BENEATH
THE SEAS</p>

<p>What a happy, unexplainable sensation to know that
you are hiding deep in the infinite ocean! The heart,
which had stopped beating during these long seconds because
it had no time to beat, again begins its pounding.</p>

<p>Our boat sinks deeper and deeper. It obeys, as does
a faithful horse, the slightest pressure of a rider's knees,
which, in this case, are the diving rudders placed in the
bow and the stern. The manometer now shows twenty-four
meters, twenty-six meters. I had given orders we
should go down to thirty meters.</p>

<p>Above us we still hear the roaring and crackling in the
water, as if it were in an impotent rage. I turn and
smile at the mate who is standing with me in the conning
tower&mdash;a happy, carefree smile. I point upwards with
my thumb.</p>

<p>"Do you hear it? Do you hear it?"</p>

<p>It is an unnecessary question, of course, because he
hears it as plainly as I do, and all the others aboard hear
it, too. But the question can still be explained because
of the tremendous strain on our nerves which has to
express itself even in such a simple question.</p>

<p>Dear, true, splendid little boat, how one learns to love
you during such trying moments and would like to pet
you like a living human being for your understanding and
obedience! We, here on board, all depend upon you,
just as we all depend upon one another. We are chained
together. We will face the dangers together and gain
success.</p>

<p>You blond heroes who are standing down there in the
bowels of the boat without knowing what is happening
up in the light, but still knowing that the crucial moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
has arrived&mdash;that life or death to every one depends on
one man's will and one man's decision; you who, with a
calm and strong feeling of duty, stick at your posts with
all the strength of your bodies and souls strained to the
breaking point and still keep full faith in him who is
your leader, chief, and commander; you show the highest
degree of bravery and self-control, you who never have
a chance to see the enemy but still, with sustained calm,
do your duty.</p>

<p>Not a word was uttered, not a sound disturbed that
deadly stillness on board. One almost forgot that the
men were standing with strained nerves at their posts
in order to keep the wonderful mechanism running right.
One could hear the soft whirr of the dynamos and, more
and more distant, the crackling of the exploding shells.
Suddenly even this stopped. The Britisher must have
noticed that the fish had slipped out of his hand. Shortly
thereafter we heard his propellers churning the water
above us. Soon this noise died away as it had come,
growing fainter and fainter in a kind of grinding whirr.</p>

<p>"Did you hear how he circled around over us?" I
asked through the speaking tube which led down into the
"Centrale."</p>

<p>"Certainly. That could clearly be distinguished," was
the short answer.</p>

<p>I was pondering over what to do next. At first we
had no choice but to dive at the first sight of the destroyer
suddenly appearing with the break of day.</p>


<p>IX&mdash;RISING FROM THE OCEAN BOTTOM</p>

<p>In our capacity as an undersea boat, we were now in
a position to fight on equal terms, and I decided to risk
a bout with him as soon as it became light enough for
me to see through the periscope. The intervening time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
I made use of by having passed up to me in the tower
the long desired cup of morning coffee, in order to stop
the tantalizing agony which the smell of the coffee had
caused my empty stomach. Thereupon we slowly climbed
upwards from our safe breakfast depth of thirty meters.
The higher we came&mdash;one can read on the manometer
how we are ascending meter by meter&mdash;the greater became
the excitement and tension. Without breathing we
listened.</p>

<p>Slowly the boat rose. The top of the periscope would
soon be thrust above the surface. My hands clasped the
handle with which the well-oiled, and therefore easily
movable, periscope can be turned around as quickly as
lightning, in order to take a sweep around the horizon.
My eye was pressed to the sight, and soon I perceived
that the water was getting clearer and clearer by degrees
and more transparent. I could not follow the ascent of
the boat without consulting the manometer.</p>

<p>My heart was pounding with the huntsman's fervor,
in expectation of what I was to see at my first quick
glance around the horizon, because the destroyer, which
we sighted only a quarter of an hour before, could be
only a scouting ship. It might belong to a detachment
of naval scouts to protect a larger ship. In my thoughts
I saw the whole eastern horizon full of proud ships under
England's flag surrounded by smoke.</p>

<p>I did not see anything, no matter how carefully I
scanned the horizon. All I could see was the reddening
morning blush spread over half of the eastern sky, the
last stars now paling and the rising sun showing its first
beams.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, nobody is here," I grumbled to
myself.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll surely come back, Captain," said my mate
with true optimism. "The prey was too hot for him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
tackle and now he has started to fetch a couple more
to help him."</p>

<p>"It would certainly be less desirable," put in Lieutenant
Gröning, who, full of expectations, was standing
halfway up the stairway leading from the tower to the
"Centrale" and had overheard our talk. "No, it would
be less desirable," he repeated, "because then comes the
entire swarm of hostile U-boats with their nets cunningly
lined with mines. No good will ever come of
that."</p>

<p>"There you are right, Gröning," I agreed. "With that
sort of a nuisance, equipped as they are with so many
machines for our destruction, it would be very disagreeable
to make their acquaintance. If they come, it is best
to disappear. It is not worth the risk. We have many
more important duties ahead of us. It would be too
bad to spoil a good torpedo on such trash."</p>

<p>At the same time, I decided to rise so as to get a better
observation through the periscope and once more look
around the horizon. I suddenly observed in the north-east
a peculiar, dark cloud of smoke. I, therefore, did
not give any orders to arise, but told "Centrale" by a
few short commands through the speaking tube the new
turn of affairs and, with added speed, went to meet the
smoke cloud.</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORY OF THE SINKING TRANSPORT</p>

<p>Soon the outlines of a ship told us that ahead of us
was a large steamer, steaming westward at high speed.
The disappointment which we experienced at first was
soon reversed when it was clearly shown that the fortunes
of war had again sent a ship across our course
which belonged to a hostile power.</p>

<p>No flag could be seen&mdash;nor was it run up. Otherwise
we would have seen it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is a suspicious circumstance," I reasoned with
myself.</p>

<p>I called down to the "Centrale" all my observations
through the periscope at regular intervals, snapping them
out in the same sharp, brief style that the newsboys use
in calling out the headlines to the listening public. My
words were passed in whispers from mouth to mouth
until all hands on board knew what was going on above
the surface. Each new announcement from the conning
tower caused great excitement among the crew, listening
and holding their breath and, I believe, if you could measure
the tension on human nerves with a barometer, it
would have registered to the end of the tube, when, like
hammer beats, these words went down to the "Centrale:"</p>

<p>"The steamer's armed! Take a look, mate."</p>

<p>I stepped away from the sights of the periscope. "Can
you see the gun mounted forward of the bridge?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," he replied excitedly. "I can see it,
and quite a large piece it is, too."</p>

<p>"Now take a look at her stern&mdash;right by the second
mast&mdash;what do you notice there?"</p>

<p>"Thousand devils! Another cannon&mdash;at least a ten-centimeter
gun. It's a transport, sure."</p>

<p>"Drop the periscope! Port ten!" I commanded.</p>

<p>"Torpedo tube ready!" reported the torpedo master
through the tube from the forward torpedo compartment.</p>

<p>By this time I had the periscope submerged so that
we were completely below the surface and out of sight,
and it would be impossible to discover us from the
steamer, even after the most careful searching of the
horizon.</p>

<p>"Advance on the enemy!" was our determination.</p>

<p>Oh, what a glorious sensation is a U-boat attack!
What a great understanding and coöperation between a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
U-boat and its crew&mdash;between dead matter and living
beings! What a merging into a single being, of the nerves
and spirits of an entire crew!</p>

<p>"Just as if the whole boat is as one being," was the
thought that passed through my mind when I, with periscope
down, went at my antagonist, just like a great
crouching cat with her back bowed and her hair on end,
ready to spring. The eye is the periscope, the brain the
conning tower, the heart the "Centrale," the legs the engines,
and the teeth and claws the torpedoes.</p>

<p>Noiselessly we slipped closer and closer in our exciting
chase. The main thing was that our periscope should
not be observed, or the steamer might change her course
at the last moment and escape us. Very cautiously, I
stuck just the tip of the periscope above the surface at
intervals of a few minutes, took the position of the
steamer in a second and, like a flash, pulled it down again.
That second was sufficient for me to see what I wanted
to see. The steamer was to starboard and was heading
at a good speed across our bows. To judge from the
foaming waves which were cut off from the bow, I calculated
that her speed must be about sixteen knots.</p>

<p>The hunter knows how important it is to have a knowledge
of the speed at which his prey is moving. He can
calculate the speed a little closer when it is a wounded
hare than when it is one which in flight rushes past at
high speed.</p>

<p>It was only necessary for me, therefore, to calculate
the speed of the ship for which a sailor has an experienced
eye. I then plotted the exact angle we needed. I
measured this by a scale which had been placed above
the sights of the periscope. Now I only had to let the
steamer come along until it had reached the zero point
on the periscope and fire the torpedo, which then must
strike its mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>You see, it is very plain; I estimate the speed of the
boat, aim with the periscope and fire at the right moment.</p>

<p>He who wishes to know about this or anything else in
this connection should join the navy, or if he is not able
to do so, send us his son or brother or nephew.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;SCENE OF TERROR AS THE SHIP
GOES DOWN</p>

<p>On the occasion in question everything went as calculated.
The steamer could not see our cautious and
hardly-shown periscope and continued unconcerned on
its course. The diving rudder in the "Centrale" worked
well and greatly facilitated my unobserved approach. I
could clearly distinguish the various objects on board,
and saw the giant steamer at a very short distance&mdash;how
the captain was walking back and forth on the bridge
with a short pipe in his mouth, how the crew was scrubbing
the forward deck. I saw with amazement&mdash;a shiver
went through me&mdash;a long line of compartments of wood
spread over the entire deck, out of which were sticking
black and brown horse heads and necks.</p>

<p>Oh, great Scott! Horses! What a pity! Splendid
animals!</p>

<p>"What has that to do with it?" I continually thought.
"War is war. And every horse less on the western front
is to lessen England's defense." I have to admit, however,
that the thought which had to come was disgusting,
and I wish to make the story about it short.</p>

<p>Only a few degrees were lacking for the desired angle,
and soon the steamer would get into the correct focus.
It was passing us at the right distance, a few hundred
meters.</p>

<p>"Torpedo ready!" I called down into the "Centrale."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the longed-for command. Every one on board
held his breath. Now the steamer's bow cut the line in
the periscope&mdash;now the deck, the bridge, the foremast&mdash;the
funnel.</p>

<p>"Let go!"</p>

<p>A light trembling shook the boat&mdash;the torpedo was on
its way. Woe, when it was let loose!</p>

<p>There it was speeding, the murderous projectile, with
an insane speed straight at its prey. I could accurately
follow its path by the light wake it left in the water.</p>

<p>"Twenty seconds," counted the mate whose duty it
was, with watch in hand, to calculate the exact time
elapsed after the torpedo was fired until it exploded.</p>

<p>"Twenty-two seconds!"</p>

<p>Now it must happen&mdash;the terrible thing!</p>

<p>I saw the ship's people on the bridge had discovered
the wake which the torpedo was leaving, a slender stripe.
How they pointed with their fingers out across the sea
in terror; how the captain, covering his face with his
hands, resigned himself to what must come. And next
there was a terrific shaking so that all aboard the steamer
were tossed about and then, like a volcano, arose, majestic
but fearful in its beauty, a two-hundred meter high
and fifty-meter wide pillar of water toward the sky.</p>

<p>"A full hit behind the second funnel!" I called down
into the "Centrale." Then they cut loose down there for
joy. They were carried away by ecstasy which welled
out of their hearts, a joyous storm that ran through our
entire boat and up to me.</p>

<p>And over there?</p>

<p>Landlubber, steel thy heart!</p>

<p>A terrible drama was being enacted on the hard-hit,
sinking ship. It listed and sank towards us.</p>

<p>From the tower I could observe all the decks. From
all the hatches human beings forced their way out, fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
despairingly. Russian firemen, officers, sailors, soldiers,
hostlers, the kitchen crew, all were running and
calling for the boats. Panic stricken, they thronged about
one another down the stairways, fighting for the lifeboats,
and among all were the rearing, snorting and kicking
horses. The boats on the starboard deck could not
be put into service, as they could not be swung clear
because of the list of the careening steamer. All, therefore,
thronged to the boats on the port side, which, in
the haste and anguish, were lowered, some half empty;
others overcrowded. Those who were left aboard were
wringing their hands in despair. They ran from bow
to stern and back again from stern to bow in their terror,
and then finally threw themselves into the sea in
order to attempt to swim to the boats.</p>

<p>Then another explosion resounded, after which a hissing
white wave of steam streamed out of all the ports.
The hot steam set the horses crazy, and they were beside
themselves with terror&mdash;I could see a splendid, dapple-gray
horse with a long tail make a great leap over
the ship's side and land in a lifeboat, already overcrowded&mdash;but
after that I could not endure the terrible spectacle
any longer. Pulling down the periscope, we submerged
into the deep.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;WRECKAGE AND CORPSES&mdash;THE OCEAN
GRAVE</p>

<p>When, after some time, I came again to the surface
there was nothing more to be seen of the great, proud
steamer. Among the wreckage and corpses of the horses
three boats were floating and occasionally fished out a
man still swimming in the sea. Now I came up on the
surface in order to assist the victims of the wrecked ship.
When our boat's mighty, whale-like hull suddenly arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
out of the water, right in their midst, a panic seized
them again and quickly they grasped their oars in order
to try to flee. Not until I waved from the tower to them
with my handkerchief and cap did they rest on their oars
and come over to us. The state in which some of them
were was exceedingly pitiful. Several wore only white
cotton trousers and had handkerchiefs wrapped around
their necks. The fixed provisions which each boat was
required to carry were not sufficient when the boat's crew
was doubled and trebled.</p>

<p>While I was conferring with our mess officer as to
what we could possibly dispense with of our own provisions
we noticed to the north and west some clouds of
smoke which, to judge from the signs, were coming towards
us quickly. Immediately a thought flashed through
my head:</p>

<p>"Now they are looking for you. Now comes the whole
swarm."</p>

<p>Already the typical masts of the British destroyers
and trawlers arose above the horizon. We, therefore,
did not have a minute to lose in order to escape these
hostile and most dangerous enemies. I made my decision
quickly and called to the captain of the sunken steamer
that he could let one of the oncoming ships pick them
up as I could not spare the time, but had to go "north-east."
Then I submerged&mdash;right in front of the boats
full of survivors.</p>

<p>(Here the captain graphically describes his escape
from the British fleet; how near they came to his capture.
He relates many interesting tales of the "Days of
Terror," "A Lively Chase," matching wits "The British
Bull-dog," and the joy of "Homeward Bound."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>)</p>

<p>The brilliant stories of American journalists form an important
part of the literature of the Great War. Mr. Williams is one
of the ablest of these correspondents. His dispatches from
the battle grounds received the commendation of Ambassador
Herrick and Premier Clemenceau of France. At the outbreak
of the War Williams was stationed in Paris. He was refused,
with all other correspondents, any credentials permitting him to
enter the fighting area. He daringly worked his way to the
fighting lines, where he was arrested, returned to Paris as a
prisoner of War and lodged in the Cherche Midi prison, the
famous military prison where Dreyfus was confined. He was
released under the intervention of Ambassador Herrick, but
still baffled at getting to the front as a war correspondent, he
volunteered for service in the Red Cross as an orderly on a
motor ambulance. The stories which he tells are classics in
American journalism. They have been collected into a volume
entitled "Passed by the Censor" from which we make the following
selections by permission of his publishers, <i>E. P. Dutton and

I&mdash;STORY OF THE AMBULANCE DRIVER IN
PARIS</p>

<p>I never expected to drive a motor ambulance, with
badly wounded men, down the Champs Elysées. But
I did. I have done many things since the war began that
I never expected to do;&mdash;but somehow that magnificent
Champs Elysées&mdash;and ambulances&mdash;and groans of
wounded seemed a combination entirely outside my wildest
imaginations.</p>

<p>This was a result of the eight days' parole, after my
release from the Cherche Midi; I was forbidden to write
anything concerning my trip to the battle fields.</p>

<p>During those eight days I came to the conclusion that
the popularity of journalism in France had reached its
lowest ebb. In the antebellum days newspapermen were
rather highly regarded in the French capital. They occasionally
got almost in the savant class, and folks seemed
rather glad to sit near their corners of the cafés and
hearken to their words. I found that now, in popular
estimation, they were several degrees below the ordinary
criminal, and in fact not far above the level of the
spy. Also the wording of my parole was galling. I
could not even write private letters to my family, without
first obtaining permission at headquarters of the Military
Governor.</p>

<p>We had "run into an important turning movement of
troops on that trip to the front" was the final official
reason assigned for our particular predicament. We
were dangerous; we might tell about that turning movement.
Therefore the eight days' parole.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, for eight days my activities for my newspaper
were suspended, and even then the hope of getting
to the front seemed more vague than ever. I thought
over every plan that might produce copy, and finally I
called on the Ambassador&mdash;which was the usual procedure
when one had an idea of front-going character.</p>

<p>"I am weary of the reputation that has been bestowed
upon me," I told Mr. Herrick. "I am tired of being
classified with the thugs and yeggmen. I am tired of
being an outcast on the face of Paris. In other words,
for the moment I desire to uplift myself from the low
level of journalism. I desire to don the brassard of the
Red Cross."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Ambassador, "I don't blame you."</p>

<p>"All right," I rejoined, "but as a journalist they won't
have me&mdash;unless you give me a bill of health. If you
tell them I am not so bad as I look nor so black as I am
painted, I stand a chance. I confess frankly that I am
actuated by the low motives of my profession. I am
first and last a newspaperman and I believe that a Red
Cross ambulance may get me to the battle front. However,
I am willing to do my share of the work, and if
I go into the service with my cards face up and your
guarantee&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mr. Herrick. "And that goes, provided
you will not use the cable until you leave the service."</p>

<p>I promised. The Ambassador kept his word. A week
later, vaccinated and injected against disease of every
character, clad in khaki, with the coveted badge of mercy
sewed on the left sleeve, I was taken into the ranks of
the Croix Rouge as an ambulance orderly. I remained
for two months&mdash;first hauling wounded from great evacuation
stations about Paris to hospitals within the walls.
Most of our wounded went to the American Ambulance,
when we broke all speed laws going through the Champs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Elysées, en route to Neuilly. Later I was stationed at
Amiens with the second French army, at that time under
the command of General Castelnau. We slept on the
floor in a freight station and we worked in the black
ooze of the railway yards. The battle front was still
many miles away.</p>

<p>One morning when the weather was bleakest (it was
now December) and the black ooze the deepest, and the
straw from where I had just risen was flattest and moldiest,
I received word from Paris to get back quick&mdash;that
at last the War Office would send correspondents to the
front, and that the Foreign Office was preparing the list
of neutrals who would go.</p>

<p>I resigned my ambulance job and took the next train.
But I kept my brassard with the red cross upon it. I
wanted it as a proof of those hard days and sometimes
harder nights, when my profession was blotted from my
mind&mdash;and copy didn't matter&mdash;I wanted it because it
was my badge when I was an ambulance orderly carrying
wounded men, when I came to feel that I was contributing
something after all, although a neutral, toward
the great sacrifice of the country that sheltered me. I
shall keep it always for many things that I saw and
heard; but I cherish it most for my recollection of Trevelyan&mdash;the
Rue Jeanne d'Arc and those from a locality
called Quesnoy-sur-Somme.</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF TREVELYAN&mdash;THE ORDERLY</p>

<p>The orderly on the first bus was sitting at attention,
with arms folded, waiting for orders. It was just dawn,
but the interior of his bus was clean and ready. He
always fixed it up at night, when the rest of us, dog tired,
crept into the dank straw, saying we could get up extra
early and do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>So now we were up "extra early," chauffeurs tinkered
with engines, and orderlies fumigated interiors; and the
First Orderly, sitting at the head of the column, where
he heard things, and saw things, got acquainted with
Trevelyan.</p>

<p>The seven American motor ambulances were drawn up
with a detachment of the British Red Cross in a small
village near B&mdash;&mdash;, the railroad where the base hospital
was located, way up near the Belgian frontier. The
weather was cold. We had changed the brown paint on
our busses to gray, making them less visible against the
snow. Even the hoods and wheels were gray. All that
could be seen at a distance were the two big red crosses
blinking like a pair of eyes on the back canvas flaps. The
American cars were light and fast and could scurry back
out of shell range quicker than big, lumbering ambulances&mdash;of
which there was a plenty. Therefore we were
in demand. The morning that the First Orderly met
Trevelyan our squad commander was in conference with
the fat major of the Royal Army Medical Corps concerning
the strenuous business of the day.</p>

<p>Both the First Orderly and Trevelyan were Somebodys.
It was apparent. It was their caste that attracted
them to each other. The First Orderly was a
prominent figure in the Paris American colony; he
knew the best people on both sides of the Atlantic. Now
he was an orderly on an ambulance because he wanted
to see some of the war. He wanted to do something in
the war. There were many like him&mdash;neutrals in the
ranks of the Croix Rouge.</p>

<p>The detachment of the Royal Army Medical Corps
to which Trevelyan belonged arrived late one night and
were billeted in a barn. The American corps were in
the school house, sleeping in straw on the wood floor.
A small evacuation hospital was near where the wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
from the field hospitals were patched up a little before
we took them for a long ambulance haul.</p>

<p>Trevelyan was only an orderly. The American corps
found this "quaint," as Trevelyan himself would have
said. For the orderly of the medical corps corresponds
to the "ranker" of the army. In this war, at a time when
officers were the crying demand, the gentlemen rankers
had almost disappeared. Among the American volunteers,
being the squad commander was somewhat a matter
of choice and of mechanical knowledge of our cars.
We all stood on an equal footing. But Trevelyan was
simply classed as a "Tommy," so far as his medical officers
were concerned.</p>

<p>So he showed a disposition to chum with us. He
gravitated more particularly to the First Orderly, who
reported to the chauffeur of the second bus that Trevelyan
had a most comprehensive understanding of the war;
that he had also a keen knowledge of medicine and surgery,
with which the First Orderly had himself tinkered.</p>

<p>They discussed the value of the war in several branches
of surgery. The chauffeur of the second bus heard
Trevelyan expounding to the First Orderly on the precious
knowledge derived by the great hospital surgeons
in Paris and London from the great numbers of thigh
fractures coming in&mdash;how amputations were becoming
always fewer&mdash;the men walked again, though one leg
might be shorter.</p>

<p>Trevelyan, in his well-fitting khaki uniform, seemed
from the same mold as hundreds of clean-built Englishmen;
lean face, blond hair. His accent was faultlessly
upper class. The letter "g" did not occur as a terminating
consonant in his conversation. The adjectives "rippin'"
or "rotten" conveyed his sentiments one way or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the other. His hand clasp was firm, his eye direct and
blue. He was a chap you liked.</p>

<p>At our midday meal, which was served apart for the
American contingent, the First Orderly asked the corps
what they thought of Trevelyan. "I've lived three years
in England," said the chauffeur of the second bus, "and
this fellow seems to have far less 'side' than most of his
class."</p>

<p>The First Orderly explained that this was because
Trevelyan had become cosmopolitan&mdash;traveled a lot,
spoke French and Spanish and understood Italian,
whereas most Englishmen scorned to learn any "foreign"
tongue.</p>

<p>"Why isn't he in a regiment&mdash;he's so superior!" wondered
the chauffeur of the second bus. The First Orderly
maintained stoutly that there was some good reason,
perhaps family trouble, why his new friend was
just a common orderly&mdash;like himself.</p>

<p>The entire column was then ordered out. They hauled
wounded from the field hospital to the evacuation camp
until nightfall. After dusk they made several trips almost
to the trenches. But there were fewer wounded
than usual. The cold had lessened the infantry attacks,
though the artillery constantly thundered, especially at
nightfall.</p>

<p>New orders came in. They were:&mdash;Everything ready
always for a possible quick advance into L&mdash;&mdash;, which
was then an advance post. An important redistribution
of General French's "contemptible little army" was hoped
for. At coffee next morning our squad commander,
after his customary talk with the fat major, admonished
us to have little to say concerning our affairs&mdash;that talk
was a useless adjunct to war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<p>III&mdash;WHO IS THIS MYSTERIOUS GLOBE
TROTTER</p>

<p>That day again the First Orderly's dinner conversation
was of Trevelyan. Their conversation of that morning
had gotten away from armies and surgeons and embraced
art people, which were the First Orderly's forte.
People were his hobby but he knew a lot about art. This
knowledge had developed in the form of landscape gardening
at the country places of his millionaire friends.
It appeared that he and Trevelyan had known the same
families in different parts of the world.</p>

<p>"He knows the G's," he proclaimed, naming a prominent
New York family. "He's been to their villa at
Lennox. He spoke of the way the grounds are laid out,
before he knew I had been there. Talked about the box
perspective for the Venus fountain, that I suggested myself."</p>

<p>The corps "joshed" the First Orderly on that: asked
him whether Trevelyan had yet confided the reason for
his position in the ranks. The First Orderly was indifferent.
He waved a knife loaded with potatoes&mdash;a
knife is the chief army eating utensil. "He may be anything
from an Honorable to a Duke," he said, "but I
don't like to ask, for you know how Englishmen are
about those things. I have found, though, that he did
the Vatican and Medici collections only a year ago with
some friends of mine, and I'm going to sound them about
him some time."</p>

<p>There were sharp engagements that afternoon and the
corps was kept busy. At nightfall, the booming of the
artillery was louder&mdash;nearer, especially on the left, where
the French heavy artillery had come up the day before
to support the British line. The ambulance corps was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
ordered to prepare for night work. They snatched plates
of soup and beans, and sat on the busses, waiting.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock a shell screamed over the line of cars,
then another, and two more. "They've got the range on
us," the fat Major said. "We'll have to clear out."
Eighteen shells passed overhead before the equipment and
the few remaining wounded got away and struck the road
to the main base at B&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The American squad was billeted that night in the
freight station&mdash;dropping asleep as they sank into the
straw on the floor. At midnight an English colonel's
orderly entered and called the squad commander. They
went out together; then the squad commander returned
for the Orderly of the first bus. The chauffeur of the
second bus waked when they returned after several hours,
and heard them through the gloom groping their way to
nests in the straw. They said nothing.</p>

<p>It was explained in the morning at coffee. "Trevelyan"
had been shot at sunrise. He was a German spy.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORIES OF THE RUE JEANNE D'ARC</p>

<p>We were sitting in a café at the <i>apéritif</i> hour&mdash;an hour
that survives the war. We were stationed in a city of
good size in Northern France, a city famous for its cathedral
and its cheese. Just now it was a haven of refugees,
and an evacuation center for wounded. The Germans
had been there, as the patronne of the Café Lion
d'Or narrated at length to every one who would listen;
but now the battle lines were some distance away. If
the wind came from the right direction when the noise
of the city was hushed by military order at nightfall,
the haunting boom-boo-o-m of heavy artillery could be
faintly heard. No one who has heard that sound ever
forgets it. Dynamite blasting sounds just about the same,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
but in the sound of artillery, when one knows that it is
artillery, there seems the knell of doom.</p>

<p>The café was crowded at the <i>apéritif</i> hour. The fat
face of the patronne was wreathed in smiles. Any one
is mistaken who imagines that all Northern France is
lost from human view in a dense rolling cloud of battle
smoke. At any rate, in the Café d'Or one looked upon
life unchanged. True, there were some new clients in
the place of old ones. There were a half dozen soldiers
in khaki, and we of the American ambulance column,
dressed in the same cloth. In a corner sat a young lieutenant
in the gorgeous blue of the Chasseurs d'Afrique,
drinking vermouth with a grizzled captain of artillery.
Other French uniforms dotted the place. The "honest
bourgeois" were all there&mdash;the chief supports of the establishment
in peace or war. They missed the evening
<i>apéritif</i> during the twelve days of German occupation,
but now all were in their accustomed places. For the
places of oldtimers are sacred at the Lion d'Or.</p>

<p>Madame la patronne acted in place of her husband,
who was now safely serving in the cooking department
of the army, some kilometers from the firing line. Madame
sat contentedly at the caisse superintending the activities
of two youthful, inexperienced garçons. The old
waiters, Jean and André, vanished into the "zone of military
activity" on the first day of the war. After several
post cards, Jean had not been heard from. André was
killed at the battle of the Marne.</p>

<p>We had heard the garrulous tale of the German occupation
many times. It was thrillingly revealed, both at
the Restaurant de Commerce and the Hotel de Soleil.
At the Lion d'Or it was Madame's absorbing theme, when
she was not haranguing the new waiters or counting
change. Madame had remained throughout the trouble.
"But yes, to be sure." She was not the woman to flee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and leave the Lion d'Or to the invaders. Her ample
form was firmly ensconced behind the caisse when the
first of the Uhlans entered. They were officers, and&mdash;wonder
of wonders&mdash;they spoke French. The new waiters
were hiding in the cellar, so Madame clambered from
her chair with dignity, and placed glasses and drink before
them. And then&mdash;would wonders never cease?&mdash;these
Germans had actually paid&mdash;even overpaid, <i>ma foi</i>&mdash;for
one of them flung a golden half louis on the counter,
and stalked from the place refusing change. Of
course at the Hotel de Ville, the invaders behaved differently.
There the Mayor was called upon for one
million francs&mdash;war indemnity. But that was a matter
for the city and not for the individual. Madame still
had that golden half louis and would show it if we cared
to see. Gold was scarce and exceedingly precious. The
sight of it was good.</p>

<p>Now the Germans were gone&mdash;forced out, grace à
Dieu, so the good citizens no longer lived in the cellars.
They were again in their places at the Lion d'Or, sipping
vermouth and offering gratitude to the military régime
that had the decency to allow cafés open until eight
o'clock. Outside the night was cold and a fine drizzle
beat against the windows. Several newcomers shivered
and remarked that it must be terrible in the trenches.
But the electric lights, the clinking glasses on the marble
tables, the rattling coins, soon brought them into the
general line of speculation on how long it would take to
drive the Germans from France.</p>


<p>V&mdash;A NIGHT AT THE LION D'OR</p>

<p>For a hundred years the cafés have been the Forum of
France. The Lion d'Or had for that entire period been
the scene of fierce verbal encounters between members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of more political and religious faiths than exist in any
other nation of the world. Every Frenchman, no matter
how humble in position or purse has decided opinions
about something. But now the voices in the Lion d'Or
arose only in appellations concerning <i>les Boches</i>. There
was unanimity of opinion on the absorbing subject of the
war.</p>

<p>The members of the American ambulance column sat
at a table near the door. Our khaki always brought looks
of friendly interest. Almost every one took us to be
English, and even those who learned the truth were
equally pleased. We finished the <i>apéritif</i> and consulted
about dinner. We were off duty&mdash;we might either return
for the army mess or buy our own meal at the
restaurant. We paid the garçon and decided upon the
restaurant a few doors away. Several of the men were
struggling into their rubber coats. I told them that I
would follow shortly. I had just caught a sentence from
across the room that thrilled me. It held a note of mystery&mdash;or
tragedy. It brought life out of the commonplace
normality of <i>apéritif</i> hour at the Lion d'Or.</p>

<p>The speakers were two Frenchmen of middle age&mdash;fat
and bearded. They were dressed in ordinary black, but
wore it with a ceremonial rather than conventional manner.
The atmosphere of the city did not seem upon them.
They might rather be the butcher and the grocer of a
small town. One of the pair had sat alone for some
time before the second arrived. I had noticed him. He
seemed to have no acquaintances in the place&mdash;which was
unusual. He drank two cognacs in rapid succession&mdash;which
was still more unusual. One drink always satisfies
a Frenchman at <i>apéritif</i> hour&mdash;and it is very seldom
cognac.</p>

<p>When the second man entered the other started from
his seat and held out both hands eagerly. "So you got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
out safe!" were the words I heard; but our crowd was
hurrying toward the door, and I lost the actual greeting.
I ordered another vermouth and waited.</p>

<p>The two men were seated opposite each other. The
first man nervously motioned to the waiter and the newcomer
gave his order. It was plain that they were both
excited, but the table adjoining was unoccupied, so they
attracted no attention. The noisy waiter, banging bottles
on the table, drowned out the next few sentences. Then
I heard the second man: "So I got out first, but you managed
to get here yesterday&mdash;a day in advance."</p>

<p>The other replied: "I was lucky enough to get a horse.
They were shelling the market place when I left."</p>

<p>The second man gulped his drink and plucked nervously
at the other's sleeve. "My wife is at the hotel,"
he almost mumbled the words, "I must tell her&mdash;you
said the market place. But how about the Rue Jeanne
d'Arc?&mdash;her sister lived there. She remained."</p>

<p>"How about the Rue Jeanne d'Arc?" the other repeated.
He clucked his tongue sympathetically. "That
was all destroyed in the morning."</p>

<p>The second man drew a handkerchief from his pocket
and mopped the sweat from his forehead.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;STORIES OF THE REFUGEES FROM THE
SOMME</p>

<p>They were climbing out of the cattle cars into the mud
of the freight yards. They numbered about fifty,&mdash;the
old, the halt, the blind and the children. We were whizzing
past on a motor ambulance with two desperately
wounded men inside, headed for a hospital a half mile
away. The Medical Major said that unless we hurried
the men would probably be dead when we arrived. So
we could not lessen speed as those from Quesnoy-sur-Somme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
descended painfully from the cattle cars. Instead,
we sounded the siren for them to get out of the
way. The mud from our wheels splattered them. But
it was not mud&mdash;not regular mud. It was black, unhealthy
ooze, generated after a month of rain in the aged
layers of train soot. It was full of fever germs. Typhoid
was on the rampage.</p>

<p>As we passed the sentinels at the gates of the yards
we were forced to halt in a jam of ammunition and food
wagons. To the army that survives is given the first
thought. The wounded in the ambulance could wait.
We took right of way only over civilians&mdash;including refugees.</p>

<p>We asked a sentinel concerning those descending from
the cattle cars, "<i>là bas</i>." He said they came from a place
called Quesnoy-sur-Somme. It was not a city he told
us, nor a town&mdash;not even a village. Just a straggling
hamlet along the river bank&mdash;a place called Quesnoy-sur-Somme.</p>

<p>The past tense was the correct usage of the verb.
The place <i>was</i> that; but now&mdash;now it is just a black path
of desolation beside a lifeless river. The artillery had
thundered across the banks for a month. The fish floated
backs down on the water.</p>

<p>When the ammunition and food wagons gave us room
enough, we again raced through the streets and delivered
our wounded at the hospital&mdash;alive. Then we returned
to the freight yards for more. Several ambulance
columns had worked through the night from the
field hospitals to the freight yards. There the men were
sorted and the less desperate cases entrained.</p>

<p>We plowed our way carefully through the ooze of
the yards, for ahead of us walked those from Quesnoy-sur-Somme
on their way to the <i>gare</i>. They walked
slowly&mdash;painfully, except the children, who danced beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
our running board and laughed at the funny red
crosses painted on the canvas sides of the ambulance.
It was raining&mdash;as usual. The sky was the coldest gray
in the universe, and the earth and dingy buildings, darker
in tone, were still more dismal. But one tiny child had a
fat slab of bread covered thickly with red jam. She
raised her sticky pink face to ours and laughed gloriously.
She waved her pudgy fist holding the bread and jam,
and shouted, "<i>Vive la France!</i>"</p>

<p>We were now just crawling through the mire. The
refugees surrounded us on all sides. The mother seized
the waving little arm, and dragged the child away. The
woman did not look at us. She just plodded along, her
eyes fixed on the mud that closed over her shoes at every
step. She was bareheaded and the rain glistened in
great drops upon her hair. The child hung back. The
mother merely tightened her grip, doggedly patient. She
was past either curiosity or reproof.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;THE FORLORN MASS ON THE BATTLE
ROADS</p>

<p>Our car ran so slowly that accidentally we killed the
engine. I got out to crank her up and meantime the
forlorn mass surged by. Two soldiers herded them over
the slippery tracks to a shed beside the gare where straggled
some rough benches. We lined our car up behind
the other ambulances. Then we went to look at the refugees.</p>

<p>They had dropped onto the benches, except the children.
The littlest ones tugged fretfully at their mothers'
skirts. The others ran gleefully about, fascinated by the
novelty of things. It was a holiday. Several Red Cross
women were feeding the crowd, passing about with big
hampers of bread and pots of coffee. Each person received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
also a tin of dried meat; and a cheese was served
to every four. We helped carry the hampers.</p>

<p>Most of the refugees did not even look at us; they did
not raise their eyes from the mud. They reached out
their hands and took what we gave them. Then they
held the food in their laps, listless; or staring out across
the yards into the wet dusk.</p>

<p>One or two of them talked. They had been hustled
out at sunrise. The French army thought they had occupied
that dangerous place long enough. There was
no longer hope for any living thing remaining. So they
came away&mdash;bringing nothing with them, herded along
the line by soldiers. Where they were going they did not
know. It did not matter where. "<i>C'est la guerre!</i> It
is terrible&mdash;yes." They shrugged their shoulders. It is
war!</p>

<p>One old man, nearly blind and very lame, sat forlornly
at one end of the line. He pulled at an empty pipe.
We gave him some tobacco&mdash;some fresh English tobacco.
He knew that it was not French when he rolled it in his
hand. So we explained the brand. We explained patiently,
for he was very deaf. He was delighted. He
had heard of English tobacco, but had never had any.
He stuffed the pipe and eagerly lit it. He leaned back
against the cold stone wall and puffed in ecstasy. Ah!
this English tobacco <i>was</i> good. He was fortunate.</p>

<p>We glanced back along the line. As we looked several
of the women shrank against the wall. One covered her
eyes. Two French ambulances passed, carrying a
wounded Zouave on a stretcher. A yard engine went
shrieking across their path and the ambulanciers halted.
The huddled figure under the blankets groaned horribly.
Then the procession proceeded to our first ambulance.
The men were on the seat, ready for the race against
time to the hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>After a few minutes the soldiers who had herded the
refugees into the shed came again to herd them out&mdash;back
to the cattle cars. I asked one of the soldiers where
they were going. He waved his hand vaguely toward the
south. "<i>Là bas</i>," he muttered. He didn't know exactly.
They were going somewhere&mdash;that was all. There was
no place for them here. This station was for wounded.
And would they ever return? He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>I looked at the forlorn procession sloshing across the
yards. The rain beat harder. It was almost dark; the
yard lamps threw dismal, sickish gleams across the tracks.
The old man with the tobacco brought up the rear, helped
along by an old woman hobbling on a stick.</p>

<p>We heard the voice of the Medical Major bawling for
"<i>les ambulances Américaines</i>." We looked behind into
the gloom of the gare; a procession emerged&mdash;stretchers
with huddled forms under blankets. As far down the
yards as we could see&mdash;just on the edge of the night,
those from Quesnoy-sur-Somme were climbing slowly
into the cattle cars.</p>

I&mdash;STORY OF A PRIEST'S "CALL TO DUTY"</p>

<p>"It's no joke, this time," said my old friend the
General.</p>

<p>These words were uttered on the evening of the International
Congress at Lourdes.</p>

<p>Hearts and voices were raised in prayer.</p>

<p>I, too, was filled with the thought of a peace which
seemed as though it could have no end.</p>

<p>But the General was filled with quite other thoughts.
"No," he said, with that fine strength which is capable of
facing the saddest emergencies and of stilling the fever
which the thought of the dreaded future sends rushing to
the brain. "No, it's no joke this time.... War is
upon us."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>And he began to explain the international complications,
the appalling pride of Germany faced by two alternatives,
to expand or to perish.</p>

<p>He showed me the uselessness of diplomacy&mdash;the
treachery of international peace-parties&mdash;the rush of
events towards the inevitable yet outrageous catastrophe.</p>

<p>In a week or perhaps less, millions of men would receive
marching orders, and Europe would be bathed in
blood.</p>

<p>Five days later, I left a deserted Lourdes. I read on
the cover of my military certificate my destination for
the first time ... my destination ... my orders to rejoin
my unit ... and that simple piece of paper suddenly
spoke to me with formidable eloquence.</p>

<p>I was a soldier, and this time it was "no joke." I was
going to fight. The citizen in me shuddered, as every
one shuddered in those first terrible hours whose emotion
still prolongs itself and is not likely to end soon.</p>

<p>But the priest in me felt bigger, more human. To
every one who asked if I were going too, I replied, "Yes,
but not to kill&mdash;to heal, to succour, to absolve."</p>

<p>I felt those tear-filled eyes gaze wistfully at me, and
that in passing, I left behind me a feeling of trust, of
comfort.</p>

<p>A mother, whose five sons were going to the front,
and who was seated near me in the train, said in a strong
voice, but with the tears streaming down her cheeks:
"They have scattered priests in all the regiments. You
will be everywhere.... It is God's revenge!"</p>

<p>How much anguish has been soothed, how many sacrifices
have been accepted more bravely, at the thought,
"they will be there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at the headquarters of a certain division of the
Medical Service, during the first days of mobilisation.</p>

<p>There, as everywhere, feverish preparation was going
on&mdash;a tumultuous activity. Through the big town, the
first regiment passed on their way to the firing line.</p>

<p>How the fine fellows were acclaimed, how they were
embraced!</p>

<p>There were a thousand of us already, and we were the
first to be called up. Half of us were priests, and our
clerical garb attracted a lot of sympathy. The love of
our country and the love of God so long separated were
now as one. It is no longer time to scoff or to be indifferent
to religion. People now wrung us by the hand, and
came close up to us.</p>

<p>An officer came up to us and before that enormous
assembly of men, said: "Gentlemen, I should like to
embrace each one of you in the name of every mother
in France.... If only you knew how they count on you,
those women, and how they bless you for what you are
going to be to their sons. <i>We</i> don't know the words
that bring strength and healing, and we are ignorant of
the prayers that solace the last agony ... but you...."
And at the words, he wept, without attempting to hide his
feelings. He already realised the immensity of the sacrifice,
and the powerlessness of man to bring consolation to
those struck down in their first manhood.</p>

<p>No, it was no longer "a joke" this time, and every one
felt it and showed it by their respectful looks and
manner.</p>

<p>The others, those millions of men on their way to the
front, were starting for the unknown.</p>

<p>We, on the other hand, knew well what lay before
us ... we should have to succour the wounded and
throw wide the Gates of Heaven for them to enter in&mdash;we
should have to dress their wounds and arouse courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in those crushed, by the burden too heavy for mere flesh
and blood to bear.</p>

<p>Never had we felt such apostles ... never had our
hearts dilated with such brotherly feeling.</p>


<p>II&mdash;CARRYING THE CROSS OF CHRIST TO
THE BATTLEFIELDS</p>

<p>"Attention!"</p>

<p>Instantly there was dead silence. In imagination we
saw nothing but those far-off battlefields.</p>

<p>Our names were called, and we were allotted our several
tasks. First the stretcher-bearers. There was a long
list of these, and in two hours they were to set out for
the front, to pick up the wounded in the firing line.</p>

<p>From time to time the officer broke the monotony of
the roll-call by trenchant remarks&mdash;such as one makes
on those occasions when one has accepted one's share of
sacrifice simply because it's one's duty to do so.</p>

<p>"You will be just as exposed as those who are fighting.
The enemy will fire on the ambulances; and the Red
Cross on your armlets and on the buildings will not protect
you from German bullets."</p>

<p>The list was growing longer. In their turn men of
thirty and forty received the badges of their devotedness.</p>

<p>"There are many of you who will never come back.
Your courage will only be the finer. They may kill you,
but you will not be able to kill. Your sole duty is to love
suffering in spite of everything, no matter how mutilated
the being may be who falls across your path, and who
cries for pity."</p>

<p>"Even the Boches?"</p>

<p>The officer smiled, then said almost regretfully: "Even
the Boches."</p>

<p>Amongst us there was a hum of dissent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I quite understand," said the officer, "but when you
remember that your duty is that of heroism without
thought of revenge&mdash;just pure heroism, that of apostles
who are made of the stuff martyrs are made of...."</p>

<p>He who had protested, and who happened to be standing
next to me, was a dear old friend of mine, one of
those valiant souls who fear nothing and nobody. He
was a fine, soldierly priest.</p>

<p>He was among the number of those who were off to
the front, and his face had lit up when he heard his name
called.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven! I was so afraid of being left behind."</p>

<p>To be left behind was a kind of disgrace we felt ...
and we old territorials who were to be sent to the hospitals
in the west, felt it badly.</p>

<p>The Abbé Duroy was already living it all in spirit.
His eyes saw the near future and his heart beat with
joy at the thought of his great work. He was going
down to the terrible "là-bas," to anguish unspeakable and
to death, and in his person, I thought I saw all the priests
of France going towards the frontiers, invested with the
divine mission of opening the gates to eternal life to
those who were quitting this poor mortal life.</p>

<p>When we had separated, in order to pack our traps,
Duroy took me apart.</p>

<p>"You are jealous," he said.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I understand. After all this new life is part of our
very being. Do you think though that it was necessary
to be mobilised in order to do what we are doing? For
twenty years, always, we have been patriots ... soldiers
who blessed and upheld."</p>

<p>There was a bugle call. It was the first signal for
departure. He held out his hand ... our eyes met and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
spoke the same great thought, the same great fear.</p>

<p>I was the weaker man, and the question which wrung
my heart, escaped to my lips.</p>

<p>"When shall we meet again?"</p>

<p>He, proud and stern at the thought of danger, repeated
my words.</p>

<p>"Shall we meet again?"</p>

<p>Then he broke the short silence. "To die like that,
and only thirty.... I'm afraid I don't deserve such a
grace."</p>

<p>Then becoming the true soldier he always was, he
struck me on the shoulder and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've an idea, old friend. I'll write to you from
'là-bas,' as often as I can ... and from the impressions
you get, joined to mine, I'm sure you'll be able to write
some touching pages. I am your War Correspondent."</p>

<p>He embraced me, and I felt that his promise was one
of those which are kept.</p>


<p>III&mdash;A PRIEST'S STORY OF THE MAN NOT
AFRAID TO DIE</p>

<p>It was night-time, and I could hear the hours striking,
hours which would have been long if I had not beside
me moaning and groaning, suffering to be consoled. We
had had to wait for them for a fortnight, but there they
were now, filling the great dormitories of a school which
had been turned into a military hospital, where we had
joined our post in the war. They suffer in silence, or
when in the throes of a hideous nightmare, they scream
and groan with the torture their mutilated bodies wrings
from them.</p>

<p>I went up to a bed over which the lamp shed a subdued
light. There lay a young fellow of about twenty, awakened
by the intensity of his suffering. I had seen him
but a short time before on his stretcher, a poor broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
thing, his eyes staring, with the horrors of his dreadful
journey still pictured in them.</p>

<p>What appalling scenes had I read in them. All the
horrors of war had become present to me.</p>

<p>Stretched out motionless on his stretcher, he looked
like a corpse, whose eyes had not been properly closed,
indifferent to all around him. Then, when we had lifted
him, and with such care, he began to scream and cry
out. A doctor should have dressed his wounds at the
front, but they had not been done for four days. On
being lifted up, his shattered leg, cramped and asleep,
gave him excruciating pain, and his whole body writhed
as though it had been on the rack.</p>

<p>I had noticed this young Marseillais, with his child's
face among all the other wounded men, and I had been
attracted by his youth and his sufferings.</p>

<p>I went up to his bed. I leant over him, and said with
the instinctive gentleness which compassion inspires one
with: "You are suffering, my child?"</p>

<p>Without answering, he withdrew his burning hand
from mine, and put his arm round my neck.</p>

<p>"Father," he said, in a weak voice, "Father, am I going
to die?"</p>

<p>What answer could I make? I didn't know; besides,
even when one is sure, one can't say it out brutally like
that.</p>

<p>Then the poor boy guessed I had misunderstood him,
and his proud, brave soul wished to keep the glory of
the soldier, who has braved danger without flinching.
Now he defied death and found strength to smile.</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm not a bit afraid, but I wanted to ask
you...."</p>

<p>He stopped and began to cry. He drew me still closer
to him. He was no coward, this young trooper. One
felt it instinctively. I knew that this lad who had lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
through the bloody epopee, was not to be approached
by maddening fear. His heart was stamped with virility.
A month's campaign had made of him an old soldier
who had gone through tragic adventures.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not afraid. I've seen so many die all around
me that I don't care a scrap whether I live or die.
But ... It's my mother, I'm thinking of. If I die, she
won't understand, and it will kill her too."</p>

<p>Little by little the sighs and moans had ceased in the
darkened ward. Only his solemn words broke the silence.
Everything else faded away at the meeting of the
two beings, at that supreme moment, more than mere
men, the soldier and the priest, to whom France had
confided the guarding of her frontiers and the treasure
of her ideal.</p>

<p>Then, knowing how nature rebounds, and trusting to
the hardy stock from which he sprang, I dared to
assure him that he was not mortally wounded.</p>

<p>"No, my child, you won't die, you are too young to
die." A sceptical smile stopped me.</p>

<p>"And what about those others 'là-bas?'"</p>

<p>All the same, I don't believe that we shall not be able
to save the poor, mangled body. The head doctor, whose
diagnosis is never wrong, said only a little while ago
that he would save him.</p>

<p>"I tell you, you will recover."</p>


<p>IV&mdash;THE STORY FROM HIS DYING LIPS</p>

<p>The poor fellow looked at me, and this time believed
me. He raised himself a little, made the sign of the
cross, and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must pray for me."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes in prayer, and I could no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
see him, for the tears in my own. To comfort him, I
placed my hand on his breast.</p>

<p>He winced. "Forgive me, father, I've had a bullet
through there, too."</p>

<p>Not only had he a shattered leg, but a bullet had gone
through his breast, and another had gone just above his
heart.</p>

<p>His shirt was red with blood which had oozed through
the dressings. Somehow it did not occur to me to think
of his great suffering. He seemed more like a martyr
broken on the wheel, with a halo round his head. This
young boy, who knew how to suffer so well, must have
fought magnificently.</p>

<p>And I thought as I raised my hand to bless him:
"How fine he is!"</p>

<p>Four medals hung round his neck, and he held them
out for me to kiss them.</p>

<p>They tasted of blood, and I still have the strange taste
on my lips of those medals which had lain over the
wound, which bled above his heart.</p>

<p>"That one, the biggest, was given me by a priest down
there in the ambulance, which was an old farm once,
and whose walls are riddled with shells. What a night
it was! and what an amount of blood there was about!"</p>

<p>My young Marseillais writhed, not with the pain from
his wounds, but with the fearful remembrance of that
night. The horror of that superhuman agony took possession
of his mind. I wanted him to sleep, but words
poured from his lips, in his fever. It was useless to try
to stop him, so I let him tell me his sad tale.</p>

<p>"We had been fighting all day long, and felt death
stalking beside us all day too. It was like a frightful
tempest, like hell let loose. Bullets fell round us like
hail, and I saw my comrades fall at my side cut in half
or blown into bits by shell fire. They uttered no cries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
they were wiped out instantaneously. But the others
... those who were still alive.... I can tell you
it was enough to make your blood run cold. It was
enough to make one go raving mad."</p>

<p>He stopped to drink a little. I thought he was exhausted
with the effort of recalling the awful scene.</p>

<p>"Try to rest now, my child. You shall tell me the
rest to-morrow."</p>

<p>But he would not listen to me. Up to now, it was
the man who had been speaking, now suddenly the soldier
awoke, the lover of his country, the French trooper
fascinated by the glory of it all.</p>

<p>"It was so sad, yet so fine. War may kill you, but it
makes you drunk; in spite of everything one had to
laugh. I don't know what makes one laugh at such
times.... Something great and splendid passes before
one's eyes.... There is danger, but there is excitement,
and it's that which attracts us.... The captain
was standing, we were lying down. From time to time
he would say: 'It's all right, boys.... We're making a
fine mess of the Huns! Can you hear the 75's singing?'</p>

<p>"So well were they singing that, over there, helmets
were falling like nuts which one shells when they're
ripe. Their voices shook the ground, and each of their
cries went to our hearts and made them beat the higher.
Then we sprang up to rush forward, and then we flung
ourselves down again flat, as above us the bullets whistled
in their thousands."</p>

<p>He squeezed my hand tighter then, as if to drive home
the truth of his story.</p>

<p>"You see, it was fine in spite of everything. Even
when a bullet laid you low.... It happened to me about
six o'clock, just as the captain fell, shouting 'Forward,
men, and at them with the bayonets!' We went forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to the attack. In front of us we saw nothing but the
flames from the cannons ... our ears were deafened
with the cry of the shells. I took ten steps. We were
walking in flames. It was red everywhere, as far as one
could see. Suddenly a thunderbolt burst in the middle
of us.... I fell near a comrade, brought down at the
same time as I was.</p>

<p>"It was the chaplain of the division, a reservist, aged
twenty-eight, who called out to me, laughing: 'You've
got it in the leg, old man, I've got it in my shoulder!'</p>

<p>"He was drenched with blood, and still he went on
joking. Then, suddenly, he became serious, and he began
speaking like a priest speaks to the dying.</p>

<p>"'Now, my children, make an act of contrition. Repeat
after me with your whole heart, 'My God, I am sorry
for my sins; forgive me!'</p>

<p>"I can see him now, half raised on his elbow; his unwounded
hand was raised, while the poor fellow blessed
us all, as we prayed God to have mercy on those who
would never rise again.</p>

<p>"I saw him again in the field hospital, half an hour
later. He was breathing with difficulty, but he kept on
smiling. It was then that he gave me his medal.</p>

<p>"He died, with his rosary in his hands, and I looked
at him for a long time when he had breathed his last.
His face was like an angel's, and the blood went on flowing....</p>

<p>"I remember that the doctor stopped at this moment,
and bent over him. Then standing upright he called the
other orderlies round and pointed to the dead man:</p>

<p>"'There's a man who knew how to die finely. The
poor devils who die before us so often, are sometimes
sorry for themselves. This poor fellow has had no
thought but for others for the last two hours. Look at
him, he is still smiling.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The wounded boy stopped, his heart was torn at the
thought of his friend. He, too, forgot his suffering in
thinking of the priest whose absolution had strengthened
and consoled him in his torture. I gave him something
to drink; he kissed his medals, especially the big one, his
precious legacy, and went off to sleep without dreaming
that he had told me a sublime story.</p>

<p>There were twenty-four like him in the ward, and seeing
them stretched out there overcome by pain, I told myself
that the humblest among them, the most illiterate
peasant even, had his share of glory, and that they were
all transfigured by the halo round their heads.</p>

<p>Somehow, that first evening in the wards, I felt that
I too had my share of courage and of usefulness.</p>

<p>Down there, in the firing line, they had found wherewith
to feed their pride; here, the young heroes would
be able to unburden their souls. At the front they had
seen the living France. In this hospital, perhaps, they
would come face to face with God&mdash;forgotten, misunderstood,
abandoned&mdash;God who is so good to those who fall.</p>

<p>The major gave us his recommendations and the last
orders. He was struck at seeing so many budding moustaches,
and beards.</p>

<p>"Heavens! I only see priests to the fore!"</p>

<p>"Priests to the fore!" That is indeed our motto. Our
comrades say we are rash. All the same, they are as
rash as we are. <i>They</i> go to the bloody business laughing,
<i>we</i> go praying.</p>

I&mdash;THE STORY OF THE DEPOT D'ECLOPES</p>

<p>The dépot d'éclopés is just beyond the town, on the
Roman road. The building was once the Convent of the
Poor Claires. When the Sisters were sent away it was
used as Communal Schools. There is a great plane tree
outside the door in the yellow wall, and a bench in the
shade. There is room for seven éclopés to sit crowded
together on the bench. They bring out some chairs also.</p>

<p>All day long, and every day, as many of the éclopés as
can get about, and do not mind that the road see them,
and can find space in the shade of the plane tree, sit
there, and look up and down the sunshine and the dust.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>Some of them have one leg, and some of them have one
arm. There is one of them who is packed into a short
box on wheels. He sits up straight in the box, and he
can run it about with his hands on the wheels. There is
another in such a little cart, but that one has to lie on
his back, and cannot manage the wheels himself. There
is one who lies on a long stretcher, that they fix on two
hurdles. There are two who are blind. The two blind
men sit, and stare and stare....</p>

<p>I often go and stay with the éclopés at the gate, they
like to have anybody come. It was a long time before
I dared go in at the gate.</p>

<p>Inside the gate there is a courtyard that was once
the nuns' garden, with their well in the middle of it and
their fruit trees trained along the walls. And there,
there move about all day, or keep to the shadow, of first
the east wall, then the west, those of the éclopés whom
the road must not see.</p>

<p>Some of them look up at you when you come in. But
most of them turn away from you.</p>

<p>The two blind men at the gate who stare and stare,
they cannot see the golden town or the golden mountains.
They cannot see the compassion and the kindness that
there is for them in the faces of all those who look
upon them.</p>

<p>But these men in the courtyard, however will they
learn to bear, down all their lives, the looks that there
will be for them in the most kind, compassionate faces?</p>

<p>There are not ever enough chairs under the plane tree.
There are more éclopés than there are chairs. How they
laugh! They think it very droll to see a man who has
only his left leg and a man who has only his right leg
sharing a chair.</p>

<p>The men who have no legs say that that is not nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
so bad as having no arms. They say that the men with
no arms are ashamed to be seen, like the men wounded
in the face. They say that the men with no arms will
never come out even to the gate.</p>

<p>They never will let you stand. It is a dreadful thing
to do, to take one of their chairs. But they like to talk
to a stranger.</p>

<p>All of them, except the man whose spine has been
hurt, love to talk.</p>

<p>The man whose spine has been hurt lies all day, the
days he can be brought out, on a stretcher, never stirring.
He never speaks except to say one thing. He is very
young. He looks as if he were made of wax.</p>

<p>He keeps saying, "How long the days are at this season!"</p>

<p>He will ask, over and over again, "What time is it?"
and say, "Only eleven o'clock?" Or, "Only three
o'clock?"</p>

<p>And then always, "How long the days are at this season!"</p>

<p>They are taking out for a walk those of the éclopés
who are fit for it. There must be nearly a hundred of
them. In every possible sort of patched, discolored uniform,
here they come hopping and hobbling along. They
have more crutches and canes than feet among the lot of
them.</p>

<p>One of the men who has no legs goes so fast on his
wooden stump and his crutches that everybody stops
to look, and all the éclopés laugh, and the people stopping
to look, laugh, and he laughs more than any of them.</p>

<p>If things are tragic enough, they are funny. I have
come to know that, with the éclopés at the gate. And
inside the gate, with those of the éclopés who keep back
against the walls, I have come to know that the only
safety of life is death.</p>

<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE OLD WOMAN AND THE
OMELET</p>

<p>The vine was red on the white old soft wall. It was
very beautiful. There were masses of purple asters
under the red vine, against the wall. There was a bowl
of purple asters on the table between the carafes of red
and white wine.</p>

<p>We had an omelet and bread and butter and raspberries,
and water, very beautiful in the thick greenish
glasses.</p>

<p>Under the yellow boughs of the lime tree we could
see the misty valley and the mountains.</p>

<p>The table had a red-and-white cloth.</p>

<p>The little old thin brown woman who served us wanted
to talk all the time with us. She wanted to talk about
the omelet; she had made it and was very proud of it.
She wanted to talk about the war and to talk about her
son.</p>

<p>She said that there had been some horrible, strange
mistake and that people thought that he was dead. She
had had a paper from the Ministry of War telling her
he was dead. It was very strange. She had had a letter
also from the Aumonier, telling her he was dead.
But, of course, she knew.</p>

<p>She said he would come home, and be so sorry she had
had such dreadful news, and so glad that she had not believed
it.</p>

<p>They would laugh together. He had beautiful white
teeth, she said, and his eyes screwed tight up when he
laughed.</p>

<p>She told us how she and he would laugh together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE APACHE BABY&mdash;AND
ITS WAYWARD MOTHER</p>

<p>They telephoned from the cantine that the baby of
the girl Alice was dead at the hospital, and that the funeral
was to be from there that afternoon at three o'clock,
and that Alice wanted me to come.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Renée, the économe, who telephoned,
said it was the apache girl with the ear-rings.</p>

<p>I don't know why she wanted me to come to the funeral
of her baby. Of the nearly three hundred women
who came twice every day to the cantine, she had never
been especially my friend. Her baby had been a sick
little thing, and I had been touched by her wild love of
it. It had no father, she told me. We never ask questions
at the cantine, but she had been pleased to tell me
that. She had said she was glad, because, so, it was all
her own. She had rocked it as she held it wrapped in
the folds of her red shawl, and shaken her long bright
ear-rings, laughing down at it, over her bowl of soup.
And now it is dead.</p>

<p>Claire came to me. We had just time, if we took a
taxi, to get to the hospital, stopping on the way for some
flowers. It was raining more or less, and very dark.</p>

<p>At the hospital they sent us round to the back, to a
sort of shed opening on a street that was being built up,
or had been torn down, I don't know which, desolate in
the rain.</p>

<p>In the room of the shed there were two families in
black, two mothers with dingy crape veils, and two dead
babies in unpainted pine boxes that were open.</p>

<p>The baby in the box on the right was quite big, the
size of the most expensive doll one could get for a rich
little girl at Christmas. There was a quite fine white tin
wreath on the floor, tilted up against the pine box. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
family of the bigger baby was quite numerous, half a
dozen women, an old man, and several children. They
all had shoes, and several of the women had umbrellas,
and one of them had a hat.</p>

<p>In the smaller box was the baby of Alice, very, very
small and pinched and blue, even more small and pinched
and blue than when she used to bring it to the cantine.
The family of Alice consisted of a small boy with bare
feet and no hat, a small girl with a queer colored skirt
and felt slippers and a bit of black crape over her red
hair, and a boy of perhaps seventeen, also in felt slippers,
with his coat collar turned up and a muffler round
his chin and his cap dragged down over his eyes. Alice
had a hat and a crape veil and a black coat and skirt, and
down-trodden, shapeless shoes much too big for her.</p>

<p>There was a small bunch of violets in the pine box
with the baby.</p>

<p>We put our roses down on the floor at the foot of the
box.</p>

<p>Both babies had on the little white slips that the hospital
gives.</p>

<p>The family of the bigger baby, and the brother and
sister of Alice, stared at us.</p>

<p>The mother of the bigger baby stood leaning against
the wall, her head against the whitewash, her two hands
over her eyes. She was making a queer little noise
through her teeth. She kept it up all the time we were in
the shed, a sort of hissing. She never once uncovered
her eyes.</p>

<p>Alice was standing close, close beside her baby in the
pine box, just looking down at it. She never took her
eyes from it. She is a tall, straight girl, but she was
bent over, as if she were feeble and old. Her veil was
pushed back from her face. It had been wet, and the
black had run over her face. But it must have been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
rain, for she was not crying at all. All the time in the
shed she never moved or cried at all.</p>

<p>Her little brother and sister stood back as if they were
afraid of her.</p>

<p>Claire and I waited near the door of the shed.</p>

<p>For a long time we waited like that.</p>

<p>Then two croquemorts came, in their shining black
clothes. One of them had a sort of hammer in his
hand.</p>

<p>They went to the box of the bigger baby, and one of
them picked up the cover of the box and put it on, and
the other began to drive the nails in.</p>

<p>When he drove the first nail in, the woman with her
eyes covered so she could not see him, heard, and knew
what it was, and began to shriek. With her hands over
her eyes she stood against the wall and shrieked.</p>

<p>The croquemort drove in all the nails, and the woman
kept on shrieking.</p>

<p>Then the other croquemort put the tin wreath on the
lid of the box, and then both of them came over to our
baby.</p>

<p>Alice had been just looking and looking at her baby.
When the men came, and one of them took up the lid
of the box from the floor, and the other stood with his
hammer, she gathered herself up as if she would spring
upon the men who would take her little dead thing from
her and put it away for ever. I thought she would fight
over it, quite mad. The little brother and sister stood
away from her, shivering.</p>

<p>But what she did was to stoop and take up our roses
from where they lay on the floor, and put them into the
pine box with the baby. She put them all in about the
baby, covering it with them. She hid it away under
roses and then stood close, close to it, while the croquemort
drove the nails in, all the nails, one by one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Then one of the croquemorts took up the box of the
bigger baby and carried it out of the shed and put it,
with the tin wreath on the top of it, into a hearse that
there was waiting on the left of the door. And the other
croquemort took up the box of Alice's baby and carried
it out, and put it into a hearse that was waiting on the
right of the door.</p>

<p>The family of the bigger baby followed away, after the
hearse and one of the croquemorts, toward the depths of
the city, two of the women leading the baby's mother,
who still kept her hands over her eyes, but was not shrieking
any more, only sobbing. I know no more of them
after that.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;THE FUNERAL PROCESSION OF THE
ILLEGITIMATE BABY</p>

<p>Alice went out of the door alone, and turned to the
right, after the hearse in which was her dead child.</p>

<p>Our croquemort would have gone ahead of her, but
she would not let him pass. She would not have him
between her and her baby. She kept close, close to the
hearse, almost touching it, all the way.</p>

<p>The croquemort walked behind her, and the brothers
and sister walked behind him, and Claire and I at the
end of it.</p>

<p>We went through a tangle of poor streets, narrow and
crowded. People drew back out of our way; some of
them crossed themselves, and all of them were silent for
an instant as the apache baby passed.</p>

<p>We went through wide, forlorn streets of coal yards
and warehouses and factories. The carters and laborers
in those streets stopped to look at us and made the
sign of the Cross, for the baby passing.</p>

<p>We went over the canal bridge and the railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
bridges, and along desolate streets of the outskirts, all
in the rain.</p>

<p>We went by barracks, where many blue coats, going
about their duties, or standing idly about, drew up to
salute the baby in its poor little unpainted rough box.</p>

<p>At the fortifications many blue coats were digging
trenches, and they all looked up and stopped their work
to salute the baby.</p>

<p>Twice we met groups of the blue coats marching along
the muddy empty roads, and both times the officer halted
his men to salute the apache baby going by.</p>

<p>The bigger brother walked like a true apache, slouching
and slinking along, shoulders hunched up, head sunk
down, face hidden between his muffler and the peak of
his cap. The smaller brother and the sister slouched too.
But Alice walked quite straight, her head up, close, close
to her child.</p>

<p>So we came to the cemetery, in at the gates, and along
a street of little marble houses, to a field where there were
only wooden and black iron crosses, and to a hole that
was dug in the red, wet earth.</p>

<p>There was a man waiting for us by the hole. He
helped the croquemort to take the box out of the hearse
and put it in the hole.</p>

<p>Alice stood close, close to the edge, looking down into
the grave.</p>

<p>The rest of us stood together behind her.</p>

<p>The croquemort gave her a little spade, and told her
what to do with it.</p>

<p>Then she stooped down and dug up a spadeful of earth
and threw it into the hole where they had put the box.</p>

<p>Each of us went in turn to give earth to earth. And
then it was over.</p>

<p>Alice stood close, close to the edge of the hole, and
looked and looked down into it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>The croquemort said something to Alice, but she did
not move. He then spoke to the bigger brother, who
shuffled up to Alice and tugged at her sleeve.</p>

<p>But still she did not move.</p>

<p>The smaller brother began to cry.</p>

<p>Then the sister went to Alice and pulled at her other
sleeve.</p>

<p>"Take her away," the croquemort said to me.</p>

<p>I said, "Dear, we must go."</p>

<p>Without looking at me, she said, "I&mdash;I stay here."
She stood close, close to the hole and looked at the little
pine box, and said again, quite quietly, "I stay here."</p>

<p>I said, "You cannot stay," stupidly, as if we were discussing
any ordinary coming or going.</p>

<p>Her little sister, pulling at her skirt, said, "Say then,
ask thou the lady to let thee go to supper at the cantine."</p>

<p>"The cantine is for those who have babies," Alice answered.
Then she looked at me for the first time, her
great wild eyes, in her face that was stained and streaked
where the black from the wet crape had run.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>I&mdash;STORY OF A PRIVATE&mdash;LOOKING
BACKWARD</p>

<p>Paris again, with its streets, where one can walk where
one likes, and its restaurants, where one can eat what
one pleases, its real houses, real laughter, and real bread!
There it is, after seven days and seven nights in the
train. I look at my ragged and buttonless overcoat, with
its strap pinned on by a safety pin, and the dirty strip
of stuff which was once my red cross <i>brassard</i>, and I
fancy it is all a dream.</p>

<p>People ask me to "tell them all about it." That isn't
easy; just at present I am afraid of losing grip of my
will and memory. I think I have lost the taste for writing,
just as I have lost the taste for good tobacco and
good wine. These last two days I have been constantly
asked what I thought of such and such a wine or cigar.
I tell you I don't "think" anything at all. I have lost
the habit of such flavours, and it is only by degrees that
I shall begin to understand them again. Give me
time....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p>In the same way I must have time to think before
telling my story. For the moment I can only see the
past&mdash;all that happened nine months ago&mdash;through a mist
of confused impressions, with here and there some quite
unimportant event in clear relief against it. I can see the
bustle and hurry of mobilisation, our start from the barracks,
our marching through Nancy, and people crowding
round us with fruit and wine and flowers; there was
a dahlia or a rose stuck in every man's gun-barrel. Then
the strains of the <i>Marseillaise</i> and the <i>Chant du Départ</i>.
We were covered with sweat and dust, and women embraced
us. Then, and for the first time, I had a feeling
that we were on our way to things heroic and difficult&mdash;things
we <i>had</i> to do, however difficult. And then on we
went again, and here my recollections become confused&mdash;a
medley of crossing the frontier and tearing down the
frontier posts; the first sound of the guns; the first fusillade;
the men who fell, who had to be left behind our
lines; the Boches in flight; the intoxication of advancing;
and then the sudden halt at Morhange. Why did we
stop there? I have not the least idea; a private soldier
never has. I remember marches and counter-marches at
night, heartrending marches on roads crowded with
troops, among dragoons, gunners with their guns, carts
of all sorts, and ambulances and wounded men who were
being attended to. Then we fell back, and at the Grand
Couronné de Nancy we were told to halt. There was a
rumour that the enemy was quite near, and that he must
not be allowed to advance any farther. There was a
battle, and I can see Chasseurs and colonial troops dashing
on before us, through the din of battle, with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
bayonets, and that was the last we saw of them. We
were told that the Bavarian troops in front of them were
giving ground. The noise of the guns was terrible, and
we dug trenches with bullets whistling around us. Days
went by; we were still waiting, and every evening after
the day's bombardment we saw a village in flames. They
all flared up, one after the other. Would the village
we were holding be spared?</p>

<p>No, its turn soon came; and a shell fell on the hospital,
and several of our wounded were killed, and then the
church!... I can see the ornaments of the altar scattered
in the road, and the windows as full of holes as a
spider's web, and above it all the torn and riddled carcase
of the belfry. All the time the unceasing thunder of the
guns made one dizzy. We were told we were near a
place the Germans wanted to take, which we were to
defend at all costs. The Chasseurs had been fighting
like mad for two days, and we were sent at night to
relieve them. We crawled to their position, and crept
into their trenches, which were covered with branches.
Later we were told that the Kaiser was there watching us
and awaiting a triumphal entry into Nancy.</p>


<p>II&mdash;THE ROAD LITTERED WITH DEAD
BODIES</p>

<p>We were fairly comfortable in the trench, which was
covered with branches and leaves. Bullets passed overhead,
almost without touching us. From time to time
there was an attempt at an attack, and the grey helmets
came on. Then the word of command, "Fire!" and we
saw men dropping and hurrying back. We were full of
confidence, almost cheerful.</p>

<p>And then I saw the comrade who suddenly ran towards
us through the ever-increasing din of the cannonade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
There was blood on his face, and he told our captain
that a neighbouring trench had given way under shellfire,
and that we were outflanked and would be rolled
up. Then we saw them advancing on our right, with
their bayonets, and pouring a steady rain of bullets upon
the trench which we had to abandon. It was an awful
moment. To get away from this infernal spot and take
up another position we had to cross a strip of ground
rather more than two hundred yards across. There was
nothing for it but to face the steady concentrated fire,
which took a heavy toll of us. A man dropped at every
step of the way, and when we formed up to retake the
trench we had lost, we looked round, and half the company
was gone. Then we fell back again; I still do not
know why. I felt that the deafening machine-guns were
tearing gaps in our ranks; we were very hungry and
thirsty and quite exhausted, but our <i>moral</i> was not bad.
And I suddenly remembered our feelings when a small
notice was put up on the door of the farm where we
were billeted one evening long ago&mdash;an order from general
headquarters to hold firm "at any cost" until a certain
day in September that was mentioned. Only one
week more! We counted the days and hours. At last
the time came, and the German menace, instead of pressing
on, was rolled back. The Germans were not going
to take Nancy; they were in retreat. What could have
happened?</p>

<p>Before we followed them up the roll was called. My
poor company! Of our squad only three were left. The
lieutenants and corporals were all gone; we had but one
sergeant; the <i>liaison</i> men, the hospital orderlies, and the
stretcher-bearers were all killed. We had to have others
at once, and I was chosen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We were occupying villages which the Boches had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
abandoned; and this inaction in this melancholy and deserted
countryside, in these ruined villages, among these
poor little pillaged houses and among these weeping peasants
was worse than fighting. There was nothing much
to do while we waited for the fighting to begin again,
and that was bad for us. We had time to become downhearted
and think too much of home.</p>

<p>Then we got good news. We were to leave! It seemed
we were not wanted in the east, but should be useful in
the north. So we started for the north. We were in
good spirits again, without knowing why. The journey
was pleasant, and at every station people crowded round
the trains into which we were packed, and cheered us and
brought us drinks, food, flowers and tobacco. It was
just the same when we reached our journey's end: we
were taken possession of; everybody was ready and
willing to give us food and lodging. The Boches, apparently,
were quite close. Meanwhile I was delighted
to make the acquaintance of this land of plenty and land
of Cockaigne, where one felt so proud of being a soldier,
and so content to be alive.</p>

<p>Our joy was short-lived. Two hours after we detrained
we were told that the Germans were attacking
D&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>So we left the town to fight again. Then two days
were spent in the hideous tumult and fever of battle, in
picking up our wounded under fire. The second day
the commanding officer came to the dressing station
where I was and said that his battalion was evacuating
the village, and that we must remove our wounded at
once as best we could. A peasant woman lent us her
horse, another a four-wheeled cart; the horse was put in
and the cart loaded. It soon was full, and we set out,
jolting along a road littered with dead bodies and
wounded, with dead horses and limbers without drivers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and bordered with burning ricks. Shells were bursting
round us; and I remember, like a picture, the commanding
officer coming back, explaining something, and making
signs. Our retreat was cut off, and the regiment
quitted the road, and marched across country in good
order to some destination unknown to me. But where
should I take the cart, which had to keep to the road?
I decided to drive straight on.</p>

<p>There was a village five hundred yards or so further
on. Perhaps we should be safe there. So I lashed the
horse I was leading, running as fast as I could to keep
up with its gallop, under the fire of a German machine-gun
which swept the road. The bullets whistled by,
knocking up dust and pebbles around us, and rattling
off the hood of the cart. We went on running as fast
as we could. Twice the horse was hit, and stumbled;
the third time he dropped. The machine-gun never
ceased firing.</p>

<p>There was only one orderly with me, and together we
lifted the wounded men from the cart and put them
under cover behind a rick. Then we waited. The day
seemed unending. The regiment had disappeared, and
we were left alone by this deserted road, where the bullets
were still whistling. One soldier, who was only
slightly wounded, tried to join his comrades, and fell
as he started to run. The machine-gun never gave us a
moment's peace. Then evening fell, a fine late summer
evening, bringing us a little coolness and darkness. Perhaps
the firing would cease, and we could overtake our
men. We would find a horse or push the cart, and get
out of our difficulty somehow. But what was that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>


<p>III&mdash;HOW WE WERE CAPTURED BY THE
BOCHES</p>

<p>Two hundred yards from us, in the deepening twilight,
appeared a row of dark silhouettes, which vanished
again. We looked at them in utter astonishment. The
machine-gun had ceased firing. Then the black silhouettes
appeared and vanished again. There was no possible
doubt: it was the Boches. What was to be done?
We were only a party of wounded, guarded by two unarmed
men, and a dead horse. We waited for the final
volley to make an end of us. Then a Chasseur, with his
knees broken, had an inspiration. With a finger dipped
in blood from his wounds, he traced a red cross on a
handkerchief, tied it to the end of a bayonet, and waved
it. We thought we were safe under this emblem, but we
got a volley which went clean through our party, hitting
no one. A sergeant pulled a rosary from his pocket and
began to pray: "Let us commend our souls to God."
Then the dark figures drew closer, and we could see the
shape of their helmets. They were a hundred yards,
then fifty, then twenty yards from us, and we could
hear them speaking German. At ten yards distance three
shadows came forward from the group, covering us
with their rifles. One of them called out: "<i>Auf!</i>" I
got up, and clapping my armlet, answered: "<i>Rothe
Kreutz!</i>" They surrounded us and ordered us to abandon
our equipment and our knapsacks and march. So,
slowly and painfully, the slightly wounded carrying or
supporting the others, we entered the enemy's lines. We
were prisoners of war.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I can see the farm full of German soldiers busy emptying
the cellar and drinking in silence. The barn was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
full of wounded men. We joined them, and a captain
who spoke French ordered our money to be returned to
us. All night long my comrade and I were busy attending
to the wounded, both French and German, who were
lying in a confused heap on the straw. We were allowed
to keep our instruments, and we used the men's first aid
dressings.</p>

<p>At daybreak carriages and a section of German ambulance
men arrived. Our wounded were removed, and I
and the orderly, the only two unwounded, were marched
off between a corporal and soldiers with fixed bayonets.
We did not know where we were being taken.</p>

<p>It was a sinister march as we four went silently on
past houses either empty, or ruined, or mere smoking
shells, where here and there a shrinking figure of a
woman or child showed itself. And then the dead lying
on the road, <i>our</i> dead! <i>Their</i> dead had already been
removed. On all the doors were notices of billets written
in chalk. Their soldiers were taking their ease, and going
and coming in silence, or lounging in their grey uniforms
in armchairs looted from the houses near by. We passed
inns and grocers' shops which had been pillaged, and a
cow lay dead in a field.</p>

<p>Our first halt was in the guard-room where we were
taken. It was in a lawyer's office. The men greeted us
without any apparent antipathy and gave us some of
their food, but kept the wine they had stolen from the
owner for themselves. The man in charge was fairly
well educated. He talked to me about Munich, and
showed me photographs of pictures a friend of his had
painted and also some vile picture postcards on which
we Frenchmen were coarsely caricatured. He had a
kindly smile, and really did not seem to see that he was
offensive. Then came our examination. A staff officer
entered and questioned us in perfect French about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
position of our artillery, our fortifications, and the English
army. We replied that we were in the medical
service and knew nothing about these things. The officer
did not press us, and merely said: "This war will be a
long one, for after taking Paris we shall have to crush
the Russians. But it will all be over in July."</p>


<p>IV&mdash;TAKEN TO GERMANY AS PRISONERS
OF WAR</p>

<p>The staff was quartered in the lawyer's house. We
spent the night there, and next morning we were allowed
to go into the garden. This was the sight which met
our eyes: In front of the house a military van was drawn
up, escorted by a party of unarmed soldiers in service
caps. They went into the house, and others remained
by the door, with hammers, a bag of nails, and a saw.
They very quickly knocked together large packing-cases,
and the looting was silently and methodically carried on
around these cases; a piano went into them, the chairs,
and a sofa. Every man was hard at work, sawing, hammering,
fetching and carrying. Then the pictures were
brought out, all well wrapped up, and fragile objects
carefully packed in straw. An officer, smoking a cigar,
gave directions. It was all very well done; no professional
furniture removers could have done better. When
the van was full it was driven to the station.</p>

<p>As for us, we continued our journey on foot. We
were in the charge of the police, who sent us with a
convoy, where we found ourselves mixed up with prisoners
of all arms, civilians, and Moroccan soldiers who
were obviously dazed and dumfounded at what had befallen
them. We marched all that day, guarded by the
mounted police. The police turned us over to old men
of the Bavarian Landstrum, who wore leather caps with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
white crosses over the peaks, and who were stiff in their
manner to us, but not unkindly. They were not fighting
men, and there was nothing of the conquering hero about
them. Night fell, the third night since our friend the
Chasseur waved his blood-stained handkerchief at the
end of his bayonet. Our poor little party was packed
into a small coachhouse. The captain, a fat and portly
little person, before shutting us in said: "Any one who
tries to get out will be shot. Those are my orders." A
Bavarian gave us a little soup, and we stretched ourselves
on the floor to wait for the morrow.</p>

<p>In our march next day we met on our way ammunition
wagons, enormous lorries, ambulances, guns, and
cavalry escorts. The carriages were grey, the guns grey,
the uniforms grey, the only note of colour the dolls
dressed in the uniforms of French soldiers, looted from
some shop, on the front of the officers' motors. We met
a company of infantry. One tall fellow left the ranks,
and with an oath struck one of our wounded, who had
his arm in a sling, with the butt-end of his rifle. The
poor fellow stumbled, and an officer, without a word,
pushed the brute away. We heard shouts from an
officer's motor as it passed; they cursed us, and as it
vanished in the dust one of them shouted: "You dirty
Boches!" Well he knew that there was no worse insult.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We came to a town. Our escort conversed and looked
up: they had just seen an aeroplane. It was a French
machine, and coming rapidly towards us. The German
soldiers were much excited, and we heard the click of
their rifles as they pulled the triggers. Then we heard a
whistle, and a deafening volley rang in our ears. Then
we had another painful experience. Bombs had been
dropped from the aeroplane, and we were at once lined
up against the wall of a house. The aeroplane had disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
The officers argued for a moment; then the
captain got on his horse again, and gave the order to
march. We entered the town&mdash;Cambrai.</p>

<p>The streets looked dead; there were notices on all the
walls, in French, from the <i>Kommandantur</i>. People saw
us go by without a word. One woman, who stepped
forward to give us some bread, was roughly pushed away
by a soldier. Then we halted in a square, near the town
hall. The bombs from the aeroplane had fallen there, a
shop had been gutted, and dead horses were lying in a
pool of blood. We were tired out, and stretched ourselves
on the ground. The townsfolk, who were allowed
to come near us, brought us provisions, chiefly bread and
fruit. Our escort seized them and ate their fill, then beat
off the crowd with the butt-ends of their rifles, and off
we marched again. I saw some women crying.</p>

<p>We had not much farther to go. We were taken to
the goods station, where the Bavarians handed us over
to some big Saxon soldiers&mdash;quite young fellows&mdash;who
handled our poor flock somewhat brutally. There were
all sorts and conditions in this flock which we found
there, filling the station, soldiers and civilians and some
old men among the civilians. A little lad of thirteen,
weeping bitterly, was dragged along by a big fellow in a
helmet. The child was found playing in the street with
a case of cartridges, and the Boche explained: "<i>Franc-tireur!
franc-tireur! Kapout</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> making a sign to the
thirteen-year-old prisoner that he would have his throat
cut. That is their mania; they see <i>francs-tireurs</i> everywhere.</p>

<p>Night fell. We were famished, for we had only been
given a handful of biscuits since the morning, and we
were put into cattle trucks. There were forty-six of us
in my truck, among them the poor little lad who was a
<i>franc-tireur</i> and ten wounded men. The train moved off
into the night towards Germany. Where were we going
to?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p>The little boy cried all the time.</p>

<p>(The French prisoner here describes "The Camp";
"The Germans and Us"; "Fighting Depression"; "Telling
How the Prisoners Spend Their Time," with many
other interesting anecdotes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">WAR SCENES I SHALL NEVER
FORGET</h2></div>

<p><i>By Carita Spencer, Appointed Delegate Extraordinary
by Minister Justin Godart, Under-Secretary of
State and Head of French Service de Santé</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Miss Spencer is an American girl who has been working heroically
to relieve suffering in France through various American
Committees, including the National Surgical Dressings Committee
and also the "Food For France Fund," of which she acted
as chairman. She recently collected her experiences under a
little volume, the sale of which is devoted to War Relief. "The
scenes and occurrences which are recorded in these pages,"
relates Miss Spencer, "made such a deep impression upon me
and remained so vivid that I hope the recital of them may be
found interesting to others. If any one is interested in sending
assistance to a particular class of war sufferers suggested by the
reading of these sketches, he or she may communicate with me
at 10 East 58th Street, New York City." Copyrighted, 1916, by

<p>I&mdash;AN AMERICAN WOMAN'S VISIT TO THE
QUEEN OF BELGIUM</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Paris</i>, April, 1916.<br />
</p>

<p>"<i>La Légation de Belgique a l'honneur de faire
connaître à Miss Spencer que Sa Majesté la Reine
la recevra Vendredi prochain, 28 avril, à La Panne,
à 2 heures et demie. Miss Spencer est priée de
vouloir bien prevenir La Légation, du lieu et de
l'heure ou on pourrait la faire prendre à Dunkerque
ou à Calais.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>For six weeks I had wondered where and how the
door to the war zone would open, and here at last came
the answer. "The Belgian Legation has the honour to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
inform Miss Spencer that Her Majesty, the Queen, will
receive her on Friday at La Panne at half past two."...
It was midnight when the letter came, too late to do
anything until the morrow, when I must find the way
to break all rules for civilians and get out of Paris in
three hours instead of eight days.</p>

<p>My official invitation was certainly a wonderful gate-opener.
Legations, embassy and war office armed me
with the necessary papers in less time than it usually
took to reach the sub-clerk in the commissaire's office.
Dressed in my khaki suit and my little brown hat with
the laurel leaves,&mdash;funny little hat, since become famous
because so many officers thought I wore the leaves as a
presage of victory in honour of the Allies,&mdash;with my
small handbag, heavy coat and an umbrella, I reached
the Gare St. Lazare with twenty minutes to spare.
Ahead of me were two English officers, shiny and polished
from head to foot, with their elaborate hand luggage
all neatly marked. One might think they were
running down for a week-end at the Casino. On all
sides crowded sky-blue coated <i>poilus</i>, the faded dull
looking sky-blue which blends into the horizon and helps
to hide the French soldier from the keen-sighted Boche.</p>

<p>Have you ever stood by the gate to the trains and
watched the men come up to go back to the front? Some
come slowly, slouching along in their stiff boots under
the weight of their heavy knapsacks and equipment,
tired-eyed but determined. Others come running up in
twos and threes, cheerful and carefree. Others come
with their wives and children, their mothers, their
sweethearts; and these do not talk, unless it be the tiny
tots, too small to know what it is all about. Nor do they
weep. They just walk up to the gate, kiss him good-by
and stand aside, and look as long as their eyes can follow
him. Sometimes he turns back, but not often. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
watched a while, then I too went through, showing my
papers to several inquisitive officials in succession.</p>

<p>Everything was quite like ordinary times until we
passed E&mdash;&mdash;, where we lost the last of the civilians on
the train except myself. My compartment was quite
empty, and as I stuck my head into the corridor it seemed
as if the rest of the car were also empty. But no, there
was a turkey gobbler in a wooden cage and in a moment
a French officer bending over him with a cup of water.
It seemed the gobbler, poor innocent bird, was on his
way to make gay an officer's mess.</p>

<p>Soon we came to what still remains one of the most
impressive sights of my trip, the miles of English reserve
camp. Sand dunes, setting sun and distant sea, and
tents, and barracks and tent, and men in khaki never
ending! These bright, happy, healthy faces! Why, as
the train crawled through them, so close I could shake
hands out of the window, I fairly thrilled with the conviction
that they could never be beaten. I wanted to
shout at them: "Boys, I'm from over the water too,
God bless you all!" But it choked in my throat, for they
came from Canada and Australia and New Zealand to
give their lives for a principle, while I came from the
land "too proud to fight." (To-day, Aug., 1917, thank
God, proudest of all to fight.)</p>

<p>There were the shooting ranges and the bayonet targets,
burlaps the size of a man's torso stuffed with straw,
hanging on a clothesline in a row. The boys stand off a
hundred yards and with fixed bayonets charge the bursting
burlap. But now, at sunset, they are sitting around
in groups or playing games, waiting for their evening
meal. They have not faced fire yet, but their turn is
coming and they are keen for it.</p>

<p>The officer and the turkey descended at Boulogne and
darkness closed down about the same time. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
only a shaded night lamp in the car, and the lonesomeness
of the unknown began to take hold of me. The
train crawled on about as fast as a horse would jog. I
was hungry, as with civilian-like lack of forethought I
had provided myself with no lunch or dinner. I sat
close to the window, looking for the lights of Calais
which never came. The train stopped and a kindly conductor
with a white badge on his arm, which shows that
he is mobilized, helped me to stumble out in the dark.
There had been a "Zep" alarm, and not a single light was
visible in the overcast night. I pushed along with groups
of soldiers into the station, where, in an inner room, an
officer sat at a small table with a small shaded safety
lamp and examined passports. He was duly suspicious
of me until I showed him the Legation paper. Stumbling
and groping like the blind man in Blind Man's
Buff, I was finally rescued by a small boy who piloted me
across the bridge to a door which he said was the G&mdash;&mdash;
hotel. They refused to give me food because not even a
candle was permitted. In the dark I went to bed.</p>

<p>Early next morning I looked from the window on an
animated square. Tommies, Tommies everywhere.
Was it England after all instead of France? The Belgian
<i>réformé</i> who will carry a limp to his dying day as
his ever-present memory of the great war, and who acted
as my chamberman, could not do enough for me when
he heard that I was going to see his Queen. He spoke
of her as of the dearest loved member of his family.
She was a real Queen, he said. She loved and cared
for the poor and suffering. He had even seen her once
and she had smiled at him when he wore his uniform
with his <i>croix de guerre</i>.</p>

<p>The palace motor came promptly at 12:30 and into it
I got with my little bag, wondering whether I was going
into Belgium to remain two hours, two days or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
weeks. I noticed that the car had seen service. The
glass was cracked even where protected by wire netting
and the upholstering was threadbare in spots, but there
was nothing the matter with the engine, and we whizzed
along at a goodly pace....</p>

<p>We passed in and out of towns with guards at attention.
Even at the frontier we were not stopped. The
country was flat and the roads fearfully dusty. The
heavy motor lorries and trucks which were constantly
traveling with supplies from the base to the front interested
me greatly, as they were the first I had seen in
action. They came in groups of three to thirty, and the
boys on the drivers' seats were so caked with dust I could
hardly distinguish their features. My official motor carried
a special horn which cleared the road of man and
beast. The fields on all sides were tilled. I wondered
who the workers were, when what do you think I saw?
Forty children in a row, boys and girls, all ages, from the
little tot to the boy who would next year be in the army,
each with a hoe. In front of them stood an old man
who beat time with a stick while the children plied the
hoe, and I warrant they had a happy time doing it.</p>

<p>At last I knew we must be nearing La Panne, for
soldiers became more numerous. There is always one
division of the Belgian Army <i>en repos</i> at La Panne. The
motor made several sharp turns, and as long as I live I
shall never forget the scene. Warm sunshine, a sandy
beach over an eighth of a mile wide&mdash;small breakers&mdash;a
line of brightly coloured seaside houses and villas&mdash;little
sloops on the sea and warships in the distance&mdash;cavalry
man&oelig;uvering on the sands&mdash;the dunes at either end and
behind neat white veiled nurses and brightly clad convalescent
soldiers on the walk and in the sands&mdash;the distant
booming of big guns, probably English&mdash;and the
nearer sounds of practice rifle and machine gun firing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>In a small villa I met the Queen, pretty, charming and
gracious, with wonderful eyes that seemed to look
straight through me and beyond. We talked for quite a
long time and she asked me what would interest me
most to see in the little corner of Belgian Belgium. I
replied that I should like to see everything that was
being done in a constructive way for the soldiers, civilians,
children. With the promise that my wish would be
gratified I took my leave and was then escorted to the
villa of the famous Dr. Depage, where I remained for a
week as his guest. The hospital is a wonder of excellence
in every way. Charming ladies efficiently shoulder
the burdens of the trained nurse, and they and doctors
work hours on end when the wounded come in crowds
from the nearby trenches.</p>

<p>At sunset descended an English aeroplane on the beach.
In a few minutes it was surrounded by a couple of hundred
men in khaki, just as if they had sprung out of the
ground. Then off it went, gracefully dipping in a low
sweeping curve in front of the "palace," then soaring
high as it struck out to sea. Then the beach guard
changed, and suddenly over the front only a few miles
away appeared a Belgian plane with German shrapnel
bursting in little black puffs around it. I went with Dr.
Depage to see the wounded arriving in the ambulances,
and I took a thirty second peep at a leg operation in the
doing. At dinner&mdash;a very frugal but good one&mdash;we
talked of everything except war. And this was my first
day at the front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<p>II&mdash;A WOMAN IN THE TRENCHES AT THE
YSER</p>

<p>
<i>Trenches La Panne</i>, May, 1916.<br />
</p>

<p>Seven o'clock in the morning and I had just returned
from the trenches, fairly well-behaved trenches, but real
ones nevertheless, for several German bullets had sought
us as a target in the early morning mist. It was all
unreal, for I saw nothing. Yet I had to believe it, for
I heard.</p>

<p>Thanks to the courtesy of a gallant staff captain and
a charming grey-haired general, I made this unique expedition.
The captain and I started before daylight in
the cold of a grey morning and rode to the trenches in a
comfortable limousine. The fields about were desolate,
even the trees destroyed. Here and there a heap of
stones, the remains of a thrifty farm, sheltered a small
company of soldiers. The roads were unspeakable, so
deep the holes and ruts. We passed through P&mdash;&mdash;.
There were still a few walls standing, and there we
picked up a piece of marble to make me a paper weight.
I knew the Germans were not far off, for the cannonading
was continuous about three miles down on our right.
But for all I could see I might as well have been on
the western prairies.</p>

<p>"What in the world is straw fixed up that way for?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"That is a curtain of straw which stretches for miles
along the road behind the trenches to hide our motors
from the enemy. A motor means an officer, and if they
could see us we would not be here long."</p>

<p>We stopped behind the straw screen and got out,
crawling under it into a communication trench. I had
better call them ramparts, for this district, you know, was
the inundated land of the Yser. One hundred yards in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
this winding alley of concrete and sandbag wall and we
reached the main trench, a solid substantial rampart of
concrete, sandbags and earth, with the grass growing on
the side facing the enemy. Here the soldiers on duty
lived in their little cubby-holes in the wall. They slept
in groups of fours, stretched out on clean straw with
their guns beside them ready for sudden call. And, if
you please, do not suppose that these domiciles went
unnamed or unadorned. By the irony of fate the first
wooden door we came to was thus inscribed, all in
French, of course:</p>

<div class="poem">
<i>Villa "Ne T'en Fai pas"!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">War with Notes!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wilson-Bethman!</span><br />
Hurry up, you Neutrals!</i><br />
</div>

<p>How commonplace trench life has become after these
two long years of habit! Nowadays men do not go to
the office and the shop. They go up to the trenches for
daily duties. These trenches we were in were main-line,
where the enemy was not supposed to penetrate unless
rude enough actually to break through. So the soldiers
portioned off the rough earth beside the board walk that
ran parallel to the rampart, and first they had a little
vegetable garden, and next to it for beauty's sake a little
flower garden, and next to that a little graveyard, and
then the succession repeated. Five hundred yards
beyond the main lines, across the inundated fields streaked
with barbed wire sticking up out of the water, was the
front line trench, a rougher rampart, mostly of earth,
and when it rained, oh mud! Under cover of darkness
the boys went out and returned, walking across a rickety
board walk.</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Those were sharp shots and
sounded like business. They might become more personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
than the steady heavy roar of guns sending up
their smoke at D&mdash;&mdash; on our right. We dared not tarry,
for the sun was coming up.</p>

<p>The Major of the line was waiting to greet us and
offered us early morning refreshment in his dug-out.
His dug-out was a cozy, comfy little place, two boarded
rooms in the rampart wall, high enough to stand up in,
and furnished with a cot and blankets and some chairs
and a stove and a mirror and some pictures, and, yes, a
latch on the door to enter by. If I had had no ears it
would have been difficult to persuade me that there were
men not far off who, without personal animosity, would
gladly have landed a shell in our midst.</p>

<p>The war as I glimpsed it in the many phases I was
able at last to touch upon always gave me the impression
of running up against a blank wall of contradiction. To
people who live week in and week out in the range of
shell fire, life and death take on a new relationship.
Death may come at any moment, and yet meantime life
must be lived, and one can't live all the time at high
pressure. Perhaps no more vivid instance of this came
to me than when I was sitting in barracks near F&mdash;&mdash;
as the guest of that wonderful woman, Mrs. I&mdash;&mdash;
T&mdash;&mdash;. Up with the dawn, she and her fellow worker
slaved without intermission, caring for the poor civilians
of F&mdash;&mdash;. They taught and fed the kiddies, dispensed
medical and even surgical help, going out across the
fields through the darkness at any call; gave out food
and clothing to the women who came daily to claim
their portion. Then, the day's hard work over, came
dinner, at which an officer or two, French, Belgian, English,
even American, might drop in, and afterwards my
hostess would sit at the piano and sing Debussy with a
voice of beauty and volume, while all the time the guns
would thunder, the aeros might be overhead, and men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
were being killed on all sides. One's mind hardly grasped
it, but one's emotions ran high.</p>


<p>III&mdash;IN A HOSPITAL WITH THE COUNTESS
V&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>P</i>&mdash;&mdash;, May, 1916.<br />
</p>

<p>P&mdash;&mdash; was close by the famous Ypres and had the
honour at the moment of being a bombarded town.
Hardly a day passed that shells did not fall here in
greater or less quantity. Have you ever been in a bombarded
town? Gloom? You could cut it with a knife,
and yet I could not make out why the gloom was so
oppressive. The streets were full of soldiers&mdash;Tommies,
Canadians, Australians&mdash;bustling about, cheerfully whistling,
talking in groups or going about their individual
duties. Peasant women were in evidence too, and the
little shops had window displays; but oh the gloom!
Many of the houses were destroyed and in some sections
there was no such thing as a pane of glass left. The
noise of the guns was almost constant.</p>

<p>I was staying in a hospital with the Countess V&mdash;&mdash;,
a front line ambulance in this section where fighting
had been heavy. It was an old red brick building, probably
the home of one of P&mdash;&mdash;'s wealthier residents.
The high-ceilinged rooms were bare of furniture and in
its place were rows of cheap iron cots with a wounded
man in each. The Countess was one of those charming,
dainty feminine creatures with a will of iron and a courage
beyond words. The story of her life during the first
invasion of Belgium and her escape from German territory
was thrilling. She came to P&mdash;&mdash;, where she cared
not only for this house full of wounded soldiers, but
worked and planned with others the support and care of
civilian wounded, men, women and little children, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of hundreds of little orphan boys and girls. My room
was on the ground floor. It had half a window pane,
one boarded-up window and some heavy blankets to
hang up at night to hide the candle light from a prying
aero. I simply can't describe the gloom. The Countess
said that when she felt that she could not go on another
minute, she just hunted out the box her husband had
sent her when she got word to him that she had no more
clothes and to send on some of her old ones. The box
contained three filmy negligees, the ones he loved her
best in. She got them out and spread them about the
dismal room, and then she stood in the middle and
laughed and cried until she felt better.</p>

<p>I sat outside on a bench one morning talking to a
young Belgian officer who was so badly wounded the
first year of the war that he will probably never go back
to the front. We were talking of beautiful things, music,
painting and such like. One of the ambulances drove in.
He paid no attention, it was such a common occurrence,
but I was all eyes. You have seen the ice wagon dripping
on a warm day? The ambulance was dripping too,
but the drops were red! One stretcher was lifted out
and an orderly standing by raised the cover at one end.
I saw something that had once been a head with a human
face on it. The next stretcher contained a man wounded
in the legs. One of the nurses spoke to him and he tried
to smile. The next was carried without comment to the
tiny stone hut in the fast-growing little graveyard just
back of the house. These kind folk would find time to
bury him and send a picture of his grave with a few
words of how bravely he had died, together with the
number of the chain at his wrist, to Headquarters to be
forwarded to his family. And he was a cook who had
never held a gun or seen an enemy. So they emptied the
ambulance to the number of six and then they turned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
hose on it and started it back for its next load. And
may I tell you how the ever-present contrast came in
here? Upstairs in the convalescent ward a boy, to cheer
his comrades, was banging the jolliest kind of music on
an old tin piano, impatiently waiting the day when he
would be declared well enough to go back to be wounded
again....</p>


<p>IV&mdash;VISITING BELGIAN ORPHANS WITH
ABBE OF ST. PIERRE</p>

<p>
<i>Orphelinats, P&mdash;&mdash;</i>, May, 1916.<br />
</p>

<p>We went on a long ride over the hills to visit the little
Belgian orphans and see how they were being cared for
on French soil. As there was no military motor available,
and as, for the one and only time in my war travels,
I was unarmed with papers to get me across the frontier,
we decided to go the eighty miles in an ambulance, where
I could hide in the back as we whizzed past the familiar
sentries. Mlle. M&mdash;&mdash;, in her well-worn khaki suit with
the Red Cross badge, sat in front with the chauffeur.
Within the ambulance, on the hard wooden bench, was I
with that wonderful hero of Ypres, the Abbé of St.
Pierre. What a face of strength and poise and thoughtfulness
he had! To the people of that country he was a
saint, specially protected by heaven. He seemed to have
led a charmed life. He was the last to leave the battered
ruins of the once beautiful Ypres. They say he
saved even the cats before he would depart, and still the
longing to return to his beloved town came over him so
strongly that at times his friends had great difficulty in
restraining him. He loved every stone and he godfathered
every poor child of the village. Shells have
burst all around him, killing those at his side, but, by
some wonder of fate, have left him untouched. His
smile was a delight, his conversation a charm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Along the white, dusty road we flew, for we had many
miles to cover and several stops to make. Every one is
familiar with the beautiful rolling country of this part of
France, the cultivated fields, the neat little villages, the
white ribbon of road between the well-ordered rows of
trees. I could not resist waving a triumphant salute at
the astonished sentries when they realized they had let
pass an ambulance with a civilian in it, and a woman
at that! But the clouds of dust hid us from view before
they could do anything about it. We passed through
B&mdash;&mdash;, a lovely little town way up on a hilltop, from
which we could look down over the distant valley in
whose heart the hostile lines of trenchmen fought for
supremacy. We stopped here to leave a message with
an officer and learned that nearly every one in the town
was ill with a touch of asphyxiating gas. It seemed that
the fumes had penetrated this far during the night, but
were not strong enough to awaken people. So they had
inhaled unconsciously. Every one sleeps with a gas mask
at the head of his bed in these parts.</p>

<p>We coasted down the long hill on the other side of the
town, glorying in the beauty of the extended view before
us. How could there be anything but happiness in the
world that brilliant morning! The Abbé and I talked
of many things and he told me how he and the Countess
planned and worked to get enough money and clothing
for the hundreds of orphans in their care. If only some
of the discarded but still useful warm clothing of my
little friends in America could be sent! And think of the
untold joy some of their superfluous toys would give!</p>

<p>Our first stop was to see the boys, and certainly for
me it was a unique experience. The Abbé announced
that a great treat was in store for us, as we were to
lunch with the priests of W&mdash;&mdash;, who ran the <i>orphelinat</i>.
He told me to be sure to ask Father &mdash;&mdash;, the jolly, fat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
old fellow, to sing and recite for us. He said it would
please him enormously and would give us untold amusement,
and he was right. We entered the courtyard of an
old stone house, and after shaking off several layers of
the white dust, went in to the bounteous feast prepared
in our honour. The welcome was simple and cordial.
We washed our hands in an old tin basin and used the
coarsest towel I have ever seen. I am sure it will never
wear out. Then we sat down to enough food for twenty
instead of six, and how they did enjoy it! I don't wonder
Father &mdash;&mdash; was almost as broad as he was long, if
he enjoyed every meal as much as he did this one. He
ordered up <i>the</i> wine from the cellar, the last precious
bottle he had carried away from Ypres, and then, after
much persuasion, he rose at his end of the table and in
a dear, gentle, cracked old voice, mouthing his words so
that his apparently one remaining front tooth was much
in evidence, he sang the favourite songs of his youth.
I am sure they were funny because he laughed at them
so heartily himself.</p>

<p>Luncheon over, we walked to the boys' dormitories.
How they did love the jolly old priest, and how glad
they were to see the Abbé! From all corners of the
courtyard they dropped their play or their fight, as the
case was, and came running with all the joy of a pack
of little tail-wiggling fox terriers, to throw themselves
upon the two men. Where he carried it, I do not know,
but the Abbé produced cake after cake of chocolate and
every boy had a bite.</p>

<p>The boys are taught all the simple studies and always
to sing. The Belgian peasant children really sing beautifully.
Even the little tots can take parts. We went
up through the dormitories. There were closely filled
rows of cots graduated in size, and over the foot of each
one the sisters in charge had neatly laid out the boy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
<i>other</i> suit, for to-morrow would be Sunday and they
would all be dressed up. The lavatories consisted of
wooden benches, again graduated in height, with tin
basins and towels on them, about one to every three boys.
It made me shiver to think how cold that place must be
during the long damp winter, but then the peasant is used
to such hardships. Finally we came to the schoolroom,
where the older boys were already hard at work, learning
in both Flemish and French. And of all the cute
sights I ever saw, here happened the very cutest. The
tiny tots, three and four years old, had finished their
lunch and their playtime, and must have their noon-day
nap. Were they put to bed like ordinary babies? Oh,
no. They tumbled into the schoolroom, their big eyes
staring out of their chubby, round, little faces, full of
wonder as to who the strange lady was. Somewhat
abashed and very quietly they slid along their baby bench,
snuggling up to each other as close as they could. Then
at a word from the teacher all the little right arms went
up on the long bench table in front of them, the perfectly
round little heads flopped over into the crook of
the row of little elbows, three blinks and all the little
eyelids closed, and like peas in a pod they were asleep.
How I wished for a moving picture of that scene!</p>


<p>V&mdash;THE NUNS IN THE OLD CHATEAU AT
WISQUES</p>

<p>Last we visited the chapel, of which Father &mdash;&mdash; was
so proud. A little musty-smelling chapel with a crude
figure of the Madonna in a high window niche at one
end. Father &mdash;&mdash; had placed above it a pane of blue
glass, of a blue which turned the sunlight into a wonderfully
cool, pure colour. He said it was the emblem
of hope to him, and that when his heart was heavy behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
his cheerful smile, he would come in there alone to
think and to pray.</p>

<p>We were in no hurry to go, but there was still a long
stretch to be covered before we reached Wisques, where
the girls were housed. So we said good-by to Father
&mdash;, his priests, and his children. I only hope I may
see them again some day.</p>

<p>Our ride was now enlivened by the presence of many
aeroplanes, friendly ones, maneuvering now near the
earth, now so high that they were almost lost to sight.
They were probably indulging in preliminary exercises
before scouting over the German lines.</p>

<p>Arrived at Wisques, we were welcomed by the nuns
into the beautiful old château, now an orphan asylum.
The Queen had recently paid a visit here and the whole
place was decorated in her honour with coloured papers
and garlands of leaves and branches. It had been a very
great and wonderful occasion for the motherless little
girls. Coffee was served us out of a brilliantly shining
kettle from the huge old-fashioned stove in the great
open fireplace. Everything was so spotlessly clean!
The nuns certainly took good care of the children. The
girls' dormitories were neat, here and there brightened
by a piece of coloured cloth or a picture or a bit of
ribbon. There were only the barest necessities, and none
too many of them. The girls were taught to do the
housework and to sew, in addition to their regular school
studies. They were all dressed in black and the Mother
Superior bemoaned the fact that the Abbé simply could
not keep them in shoes. Several classes were assembled
to sing for us, Belgian and French songs, and finally in
my honour the nearest they could come to anything
American, "God Save the King"&mdash;at least that was in the
"strange lady's" language&mdash;English.</p>

<p>I wandered away from the others and out of doors into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the garden. There were the real babies, most of them
just big enough to walk. They were digging and playing,
twenty-five or more of them, in charge of a couple
of the older girls and one nurse. I sat down on a broken
stump and tried to make love to one of the little boys.
He was awfully shy at first and would just look at me out
of his big blue eyes. All of a sudden he toddled over
to the other side of the yard and after him toddled the
whole bunch. He was certainly a coming leader. In
the far corner was a perfect carpet of dandelions. Each
baby picked one or two and, like a flock of little chicks,
they came tumbling back again to present me with the
flowers. It was too sweet for words and the tears came
to my eyes. I wanted to hug them all.... If only all
the little war orphans were cared for as well as these in
charge of the good Abbé! May money and supplies
never fail to come to him for this good work.</p>

<p>(Miss Spencer then describes her visit to the military
depots where the soldiers receive the comfort packets
sent to the soldiers by our American women; she tells
of the gratitude of the soldiers and how they idolize the
women in far away America who are thinking of them
and working for them. She then narrates her experiences
in the Italian war zone, with this appeal to Americans:
"Is there really one of us with a heart and mind
who dares to let twenty-four hours pass without dropping
his mite of time, sympathy or money into the brave
hand of suffering Europe! Men, women and children,
they need us! If we do all we can, then we are not
doing half enough! The horror of their suffering is
hideous! The magnificence of their sacrifice is sublime!")</p>

<p>I&mdash;GLIMPSE OF A BURNING VILLAGE</p>

<p>This letter was stopped by the receipt of marching orders.
It continued a little later with the following vivid
descriptive passage:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The flames of a village destroyed by shell fire, a livid
moonlight and a terrible storm, such were the precursors
of our entrance this morning into a pretty village of the
Vosges, where a dozen houses were gutted, burned or
totally demolished by shells. Chickens were pecking at
the door-sills of the deserted houses. That is war! Our
men might have been put in bad humor by all this. But
no! Their witty remarks cheered the situation. They
are laughing and chatting now, while the German bombs
are falling not far from us, whistling through the air
with metallic shrieks, followed by frightful explosions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Our men are getting used to this music of a special
style."</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE GOOD WOMAN</p>

<p>A good woman in whose house a lieutenant was quartered
told him the following story of the occupation:</p>

<p>"The worthy old lady with a black cap on her white
locks, her face lighted by the flame of the wood fire burning
on the hearth, keeps up a tireless flow of anecdote,
while the little granddaughter at her side listens with
wide open mouth. This woman seems to me to personify
the entire French race, gifted with a good share
of common sense and with intelligence not entirely devoid
of malicious roguishness. In language filled with
an imaginative quality she describes the departure of her
three sons and her two sons-in-law&mdash;all reservists. From
two of these men she has received no word since the war
began, and when one speaks of them a shadow steals
over her face giving it that stamp of grandeur which
grief heroically borne impresses. She told me about the
conversations she had with the Germans many of whom
could speak French; how insufferable and naïve they
were in their arrogance. Then she told of their retreat
and the sudden arrival at a gallop of two little Chasseurs,
blue as the summer sky, plain brave little Chasseurs!
'What a pity you are on horseback,' she said. 'Why,
mother?' 'Because I should like to kiss you.' 'Don't
let a little thing like that stop you,' they cried, and were
on the ground in a minute. 'What a good kiss I gave
them, monsieur; it was as if one of my own boys had
come back. Then amid cheers and flowers they rode off
toward the forest with a squadron of ten, on the track
of the last Uhlans who had left the village two hours before.
We never saw them again.' Isn't that the very
soul of France?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>On the twenty-eighth of September, 1914, J. T., a
very quiet man in ordinary life, writes the following excited
letter, without superscription of date or place:</p>

<p>"Courage good&mdash;always on my feet&mdash;bullets through
my coat twice&mdash;covered with the dirt plowed up by shells&mdash;but
as yet uninjured. Will tell you perhaps some day
the tragic details. They are glorious and sublime. We
are bearing everything with absolute confidence in our
victory. Victory! That was the word on our lips when
we parted at Paris. Let us repeat it, never forgetting the
men who have fallen. If I don't come back you know
that I shall have done my duty."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>J. D., who has not had a chance to wash for two weeks,
who sleeps on the ground, and has his ears continually
filled with the roars of cannon and musketry, declares
with simplicity in a letter of September 26, 1914:</p>

<p>"I love this life of bivouac though the stormy nights
are hard. What I like most about it is being in the free
air and having a feeling of unforeseen danger, the sense
of uncertainty and suspense. When the cannon is still
at night, I hear the groans and the death rattle of the
wounded who have not been picked up in front of the
trenches facing the enemy. Our recent victories have
strengthened our soldiers' confidence until now they are
regular war dogs who don't interrupt their cooking when
the shells rain around them&mdash;not until the pieces fall into
the kettle. Still the war is hard and they are waging it
against us without mercy or humanity. Quite often the
Prussians dispatch our wounded soldiers with a lance
thrust or a blow with the butt of a musket. I know what
I'm talking about for I have seen it."</p>

<p>On the fifth of October, 1914, F. writes from Fouconcourt
in the department of the Somme:</p>

<p>"The horrible rain of iron and steel that hundreds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
infernal machines are pouring on us every day cannot
dampen our courage. It is a grand thing to fight for a
holy cause like this of France. In spite of forty continuous
days of battle in the Vosges and in Picardie, in
spite of forty nights passed mostly in icy weather under
the naked stars, in spite of hunger, rain and forced
marches, and in the midst of horrors, I find myself admiring
the sublime forests of the Vosges, the picturesque
villages, and the gay little houses of red brick."</p>


<p>III&mdash;SIMPLE STORIES OF THE SOLDIERS</p>

<p>There is such literary charm in these simple letters
of men who frankly speak their noble thoughts, that they
seem hardly inferior to this beautiful letter of a young
but well-known writer, Louis Madelin, now Captain Madelin,
the historian of Danton and Fouché, and author of
the history of the French Revolution, which has been
recently crowned with the first grand Gobert prize by
the French Academy. From Verdun, one of the gates
of France which the Germans are especially anxious to
break down, Captain Madelin writes on the fifth of November,
1914:</p>

<p>"I have with the colors three brothers, two brothers-in-law,
three nephews, eighteen to nineteen years old, and
these men are soldiers of all grades in every rank of the
army. They write letters fairly brimming with courage
and zeal. Some of them have been wounded, but they
returned as soon as possible to the firing line. One of
my brothers took some Alsatian villages. He saw the
colonel and five out of six of the captains of his battalion
of Chasseurs fall. The youngest and sole surviving captain,
he took command of what was left, led it from the
Vosges to the Marne, enforced marches of forty-five
kilometers a day, keeping its morale intact and losing not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
a single man. After fighting like a lion on the battlefield
of the Marne he received his fourth galoon, richly
deserved, from the hands of the general of the army
corps. He wrote me a charming letter from the trenches
in the North, in which he said that his soldiers (like all
the rest) were accomplishing prodigies of valor. Another
of my brothers, on the staff of one of the corps,
dispatched with a message to a regiment of cavalry, found
the regiment without colonel or major. He put himself
at the head of the troops and hustled a strong force of
German infantry. I have a little devil of a nephew who
enlisted at the age of eighteen and five days later was
sent to the front. He fought like a demon with the
light infantry on the Marne and the Aisne, and when his
shoulder was broken by a bursting shell he begged the
doctors to heal it quickly so that he could return to the
front. Eighteen years old! There's your type of volunteer
that shows what a generation we have in reserve,
and with what spirit they will march to reconquer lost
ground. All my life long I shall remember the first night
of my command of a post in the Woevre, where I used
to walk with my men, the citizens and fathers of the
region, every one of them ready when called on to give
his last drop of blood for the Fatherland."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From Morcourt in the department of the Somme on
the seventh of November, 1914:</p>

<p>"Shall we ever return? What does it matter? We
march on. Some fall, others advance, and the frightful
drama continues to unroll before the eyes of the dazed
nations."</p>


<p>IV&mdash;THE SOLDIERS' SWEETHEARTS</p>

<p>Do not imagine that the soldier is bored. He has his
friends and his sweetheart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sweethearts! Don't be astonished. Their names
are Gaby, Madelon and Sylvia. Gaby is a little person,
plump, with an odor of wild cherry about her. I never
spend more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour
with her. Sylvia is more slender and frail. She smells
of the autumn heather and I talk with her for fifteen or
twenty minutes. As for Madelon, she is a grand lady
in her splendid brown dress with gold trimmings. She is
very cultivated, too, and I spend twenty-five minutes or
half an hour with her. Gaby, Sylvia and Madelon are&mdash;pipes.
During the long, anxious hours of suspense one
hardly knows what to do. It is impossible to read or
write, for one has to be ready to start at the first signal.
So we smoke our pipes. One of my men carved Gaby
for me from a branch of wild cherry. Madelon and
Sylvia were presents from my subordinate officers. So
much for my sweethearts. As for my friend he is a
very devoted personage, very silent and always with me.
He lies at my feet with his honest brown eyes fixed on
me until he drops asleep. He is a wonderful scout and
guide. Moose is his name&mdash;a black and yellow water dog
who got himself adopted on the tenth of September and
has never left me since."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our soldiers are wonderful, so full of hope and courage.
Still, when one sees them, one knows what they
have endured. They all have a tragic look, but they are
filled with energy and zeal, even though they are under
no illusion as to the possible duration of the war.</p>

<p>We shall come out victorious and France, that most
beautiful nation, will resume its peaceful, prosperous
life. War will yield finally to peace and men will live
happily forever.</p>

I&mdash;STORY OF AN ENGLISH GIRL ON THE
ROAD TO DUNKIRK</p>

<p>One day in the spring of 1915 Chris and I started off
for the front with "Flossie," the little Ford ambulance.
It was a perfect day, a cold wind blowing but a blue sky
overhead. The road between Calais and Dunkirk flew
past; the walls of Gravelines and the narrow winding
streets were left behind. Dunkirk itself was gay with
zouaves in their baggy red trousers. Along by the canal
we raced past ponderous convoys toiling up with their
loads. Many a staff car and "<i>ravitaillement</i>" wagon met
us and sped on their ways. And so to Furnes, no longer
the busy centre of activity it had been earlier, but a desolate
town with one or two large shell holes in the square.
No shops, no cafés, except in the side streets&mdash;all was
quiet and deserted. So we left Furnes, too, behind.
Along the straight bare road we whizzed, and now not
far off we heard the old familiar booming. We passed
the picket at Pervyse, and there drew up to make
inquiries.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>As we halted we caught sight of two Englishmen pacing
slowly along a side path, looking at the rows of damaged
houses&mdash;the streets of ruin&mdash;and on recognising one
as Major G&mdash;&mdash;, a familiar figure in Belgian lines, we
hailed him. He introduced his companion, Lord Curzon,
and on learning our errand they made further inquiry,
and let us know that the fighting was in the neighbourhood
of Oostvleteren. We ran on past the field with its
300 shell holes that had formed our first landmark in
November. Our old "<i>poste</i>" at the cross-roads was occupied
by strangers, who hailed us with delight, and with
them we left a few hundred cigarettes and some socks
for the &mdash;&mdash; Division. A shell, mistaking its direction,
came crashing to earth on the roadway near by, so we
hastened our farewells and shot off past the little church
that had been bombarded steadily for months. It was
still standing, but the troops once quartered in the cottages
round about had been withdrawn. The canal
bridge, where the morning washing parade was held
regularly in December, was deserted. No life seemed to
exist in that once busy spot; and the shrapnel whizzing
over us in the sky, directed against the railway to our
right, was a sign of the times. We slowed up at Lampernisse,
and sadness seized us. The church was down. I
recalled its friendly tower&mdash;the throng of soldiers that
had surrounded it, the gay faces of the little blue Belgians
that had met one cheerily on every side. To-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
there was quiet and stillness, and the outer walls of the
church were represented by heaps of loose stones. Inside
the pillars stood&mdash;broken wall, broken altar; fragments
of glass and melted lead from the windows that
had been. As we watched, the <i>curé</i> appeared, sad of face.
He came to us simply, and at our few faltering words
tears came to his eyes.</p>

<p>"There were 40 wounded inside," he said gently; "we
saved all we could." A grave at my feet was churned
up&mdash;broken bits of wood stuck upright in the earth; a
heavy stone monument had turned sideways and lurched
forward like a drunken man; and something else lay
near, thrown out of the earth to which in happier days
the priest had committed it. I shuddered involuntarily.
The <i>curé</i> asked if we could take one of his remaining
parishioners to safety: she was old and bedridden; her
cottage was there in the shadow of the church. Shells
came daily and at any time one might strike the roof
that sheltered her. We took a stretcher up the tiny path,
and in at the little door. There on the floor on a mattress
lay an old withered woman. We carried her out gently,
the <i>curé</i> helping. General J&mdash;&mdash; passed&mdash;a brave and
kindly man, adored by the soldiers. He remembered us,
and approved our action. Then he asked us to lunch with
him on our return journey.</p>

<p>We started off slowly and evenly and reached Alveringhem,
where the <i>curé</i> had told us a convent of nuns took
in such old and helpless peasants. Alas! the mother
superior refused. Nothing would shake her decision;
she would have no more&mdash;her hands were full. I looked
round the large waiting-room, and begged her to let the
poor old thing lie there. But it could not be. So we
went on several miles farther, and were directed to a
home kept by an Englishwoman for refugees. We sent
messengers on every side to find her&mdash;unsuccessfully&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
we left the old woman in the house in charge of the
other refugees, as we could find no one with authority.
We left full particulars and departed. We were late, as
the difficulty in finding shelter for our charge had been
greater than we anticipated.</p>

<p>We lunched off sandwiches <i>en route</i>, and explained
our non-appearance for lunch at Divisional Headquarters.
General J&mdash;&mdash; was very charming, and gave us tea
and invited us to lunch for another day.</p>

<p>We had arranged to dine at an artillery mess at Ramscappelle,
and so hurried on there. Things were fairly
lively, and after a wonderful dinner we had some music,
and then in the darkness went up to the trenches. The
rockets and flares were fascinating. Viewed from afar
they are strangely remote, but very friendly here, when
one crouched down amongst all these gallant men&mdash;soldiers
and heroes whose country had been torn from them,
whose wrongs cry out for vengeance, whose simple response
to honour saved the whole of Europe from being
overrun by the barbarous Boches.</p>

<p>We made sure the doctors had no cases to dispose of,
and returned to the brickyard, where "Flossie" waited
patiently. The flares and a pocket flashlight were all the
light we had, and we got off across bumpy roads&mdash;in and
out of shell holes. Once we nearly had a nasty smash,
but that was near Furnes. A convoy of great heavy
wagons had been left on the wrong side of the road, and
as lights were not permitted and the night very dark
Chris was driving slowly and warily&mdash;peering into the
shadows. She brought "Flossie" to a violent halt, our
bonnet touching the first of these unwieldy monsters!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE LITTLE CORPORAL
AND THE GENERAL</p>

<p>Three days later General J&mdash;&mdash; sent his motor cyclist
to bring us out to lunch. The courtesy was indeed great,
as the lad had 50 miles to come, if not more. Unluckily
he had a smash, and rode back on the step of our car.
He was a type of the modern Belgian youth. Well-bred,
clever, with frank, humourous eyes, and the adorable
smile of a "Parisian gamin," he kept us amused all the
way. His comments were racy, and always gallant.</p>

<p>"I am no longer a simple soldier; I am corporal. The
General has done that&mdash;because of you others, there is
no doubt."</p>

<p>And his merry eyes challenged us to disbelieve that a
simple soldier would not be good enough as escort.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are all gay," he would say; "yes, but it is
sad too. I am <i>fiancé</i>, and I have no letter from her&mdash;no,
not from the day the war broke out. I have written, yes,
but she does not answer. It is gay the war, <i>n'est-ce pas</i>,
madame?"</p>

<p>And a little later, with his childish pout: "I have had
a letter from my mother. She is in Brussels; she does
not find the war gay. She cannot see me, and she loves
me."</p>

<p>His shrill whistle, prolonged on a certain note, took
us past sentries and barricades.</p>

<p>"You see, the Belges are musical. There, hear me
whistle like a bird, and say 'Passez! passez! les
oiseaux!'"</p>

<p>The wind was keen and the roads greasy, but Chris
sat steady as a rock, her great grey eyes fixed on the
future, her mobile face calm and tranquil. Jean was
piqued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look, mam'selle, Chris is absorbed. She drives, yes;
but she will not listen to our chatter. She has no time
to smile then. Oh, these ladies who drive cars!"</p>

<p>Chris (who had danced and skated in peaceful days
with the little cyclist) turned her ready smile in his direction,
and he forgave.</p>

<p>We arrived at length at the farmhouse where Divisional
Headquarters were. The General was busy, but
greeted us warmly. He sent for liqueurs, at the appearance
of which Chris edged diplomatically nearer the coal-scuttle.
The General produced his mascot, a woolly dog
sent by a lady from England. He showed us also his
grand chain and Order of Leopold Premier given him
for his gallantry at Dixmude. Then we had lunch&mdash;and
such a luncheon as any London restaurant would have
been proud to serve. Suddenly the telephone rang.
Taubes were bombarding a village near at hand. Even
as the adjutant rang off and reported to the General we
heard the engine throbbing overhead. We all ran out to
the yard to watch the graceful death-dealing machine
circling in the clear sky. Then it flew on and glided out
of sight. The General showed me his two horses lying
down in a little shed near.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that before lunch he took us up
to his bedroom to wash, and displayed with simple pride
the bed he shared with his major and the other bed which
two captains occupied. Accommodation was limited!
He also produced a bottle of scent for our use!</p>

<p>Then he sent for his car, and with Major &mdash;&mdash; we
set off for the nearest battery. The chauffeur cared not
for speed limits, and a wild rush landed us in a very
short time at the corner of a field. We walked across
this to inspect a battery of small guns. Then we went
on, carefully avoiding the wire of a field telephone to an
advanced gun position. As we neared what looked like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
a ridge of trees we saw that these also were cunningly
contrived to conceal the guns. This was a new battery
of which the officer in charge was very proud. He told
us what good work they had done within the last ten
days. They had only been sent up then. In another
hour he suggested we might judge for ourselves; but
General J&mdash;&mdash; did not deem it prudent, so we thanked the
officer and the cheery gunners for all the trouble they
had taken. Here, too, the dug-outs were beautifully finished
off&mdash;even little panes of glass were let in as
windows.</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE MOTHER&mdash;WITH FOUR
LITTLE CHILDREN</p>

<p>The General then took us to a bridge on the canal
where fishing was occasionally indulged in. The doctor
who had lunched with us appeared, and with great glee
produced a hand grenade which he flung in the water.
The explosion was followed by a geyser-like rising of the
water, and then hundreds of dead fishes floated to the
surface and were caught in a net and safely landed!</p>

<p>Just then an officer joined us to ask if we could take
away from the nearest village four little children and
their mother, who was shortly expecting another baby.
The village was being bombarded, and the little family
were in terror. We gladly acquiesced, and the General
took us back in his car; we got "Le Petit Camerade"
(our second Ford ambulance) into action and departed,
Jean, the motor cyclist, being sent by the General to see
us on our way. We collected the poor little mother and
her four sturdy little boys, wrapped them well up in
scarves and balaclavas, and took them to the English
lady's refugees' home. Again, unluckily, we failed to find
her. Jean ran round himself to look for her, and at last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
after waiting for an hour, we left the little family there
and departed.</p>

<p>The relief of the good woman was touching. She was
not like the other woman with nine children, a husband,
and a pig, whom we tried in vain to rescue. The doctors
of a certain division were perturbed by the danger run
by the nine children (whose ages were from two to
eleven), who had to lie in a damp trench for four hours
every day whilst their village was bombarded. After
much argument, the woman consented to leave, and we
arranged with the Refugee Committee in Calais to take
them over, and we sent a big car out to fetch them.
However, when it came to the point, the mother refused
to leave the pig; all persuasion was useless, and the car
took the father and the nine to Calais. Two days later
he got permission to take his nine children for a walk;
and they never returned. News was heard of them walking
back the 50 miles to rejoin their mother and the pig!</p>

<p>Having left the four little fellows waving to us from
the doorstep, we retraced the road and arrived at Pervyse.
Here we said good-bye to Jean and took the road
to Ramscappelle. The sentries at first refused to let us
pass, as the road was being shelled, but we were in a
hurry, so they yielded. We left the car at one point and
took shelter in the ruins of a cottage, but a shell also
landed there, knocking one of the shattered walls to
pieces, and so we deemed it more prudent to rejoin the
"Petit Camerade" and race for our lives. A burst of
derisive laughter followed us. Unknowingly we had
been on the edge of a Belgian trench!</p>

<p>As we neared Ramscappelle a soldier leapt towards us
with a warning cry. We heard the cold shriek above our
heads that denoted trouble coming; and Chris set her
mouth a trifle sternly, rammed her foot on the accelerator,
and we were past just as the house staggered towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
us and fell, blocking the road behind us. We glanced
round; the soldier who had shouted waved reassuringly,
and we turned into the old brickyard. A few fresh shells
had fallen, and beside the path were two little graves
marked with wooden crosses that had not been there last
time we passed. We found a suitable place to leave the
"Petit Camerade" against a wall of bricks piled high.
The ground was rough and greasy. We hurried to the
cottage where the artillery mess was, and the whizzing
and whistling overhead denoted "activity on the front."
In fact we ran at top speed up that garden path and
hammered on the door. Friendly faces greeted us, and
we were soon inside and the table was being laid.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF A NIGHT AT DIVISION
HEADQUARTERS</p>

<p>Our hosts got us a jug of cold water and a basin, and
we proceeded to wash on a chair in the corner of the
room, the commandant and three other officers being interested
spectators. Then we sat down to dinner and had
soup and fish and meat; and then, ye gods! asparagus
and cheese and fruit&mdash;a right noble repast. The windows
were barred and shuttered, but all around we heard the
heavy boom of big guns, the angry screaming of shells.
As the meal drew to an end the two telephones in the
room got busy. There were, I think, fifteen officers and
ourselves, and two of the subalterns were at the receivers:</p>

<p>"Yes, my wife is in England. She is so happy there;
she loves the English, and there is no sign of war." The
commandant was interrupted in his peaceful picture by
the sharp voices of the telephonists.</p>

<p>"'Allo, 'allo, 'allo! Find the trench major. 'Allo!
What? No, the major, find the major; I would speak
with the major. No&mdash;the major...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>The wild glare of the exasperated man who wanted
the major met the equally ferocious stare of the man who
held the other wire, and whose voice had all this time
been cutting through his.</p>

<p>"'Allo, 'allo! Yes, this is the Artillery; yes, he is
here. 'Allo! What? When? At what hour? What?
Speak up! Cré nom de Dieu, speak clearly! Pardon,
mon Colonel. To-night towards eleven hours. Yes, mon
Colonel. It is understood."</p>

<p>By this time the table talk had risen&mdash;something was
under discussion.... Our voices rose; the two telephonists'
voices rose also. My eyes met Chris's; we
could not help laughing&mdash;this was like a scene from a
pantomime.</p>

<p>"Sapristi!" The man who still wanted the major could
not forbear longer.</p>

<p>"Silence&mdash;I beg of you. Silence. Be quiet, you with
that telephone. 'Allo, 'allo! Find the trench major."</p>

<p>From the other side of the room the other man spoke:</p>

<p>"Be quiet with your own telephone. 'Allo, 'allo! Yes&mdash;yes.
Gentlemen&mdash;ladies&mdash;I pray you be silent. 'Allo!
Yes&mdash;mon Colonel. Oh, what is then&mdash;Lieutenant
who?"</p>

<p>And so on! We were asked to write our names in
the pocket-books of all our hosts. Then someone said
"Music," and in a moment we were all round the piano
that had been brought from a shelled farmhouse in our
honour. The telephones were still busy, and one young
lieutenant got orders to go to the top of a very tall
chimney that remained standing "to observe, as there
was a certain movement along the front." His comrades
mocked him, crisping their fingers, as if climbing hand
over hand up the long iron ladders.</p>

<p>"You make a good target, George," one wit said soothingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>George bade us good-night, looking annoyed. We
heard him in the passage directing his sergeant to go up
the chimney and waken him if necessary!</p>

<p>Chris played and sang song after song; every chorus
caught up and re-echoed. Then in a lull we heard steps
outside and a heavy banging on the shutter, and as we
listened a pure tenor voice lilted:</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Piccadilly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Good-bye, Leicester Square;</span><br />
It's a long, long way to Tipperary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But my heart's right there."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"De &mdash;&mdash; de &mdash;&mdash;!" everyone shouted, and Captain
de &mdash;&mdash; entered, smiling.</p>

<p>"Where have you come from?" we asked, for we had
last seen him at Calais.</p>

<p>"My battery is seven miles from here, and they telephoned
to me you ladies were here, so behold me!"</p>

<p>We had more songs, and then the Belgian National
Anthem. It was a fine and inspiring thing to hear&mdash;sung
from their hearts by these big, strong men who were
offering their lives daily for their king and country, and
sung as it was to the tune played by Chris, with her
lovely girlish face, and the deep booming of the guns to
render it still more effective. I shall never forget it.</p>

<p>Then out in the darkness we groped our way to our
car, thinking the day's adventures were ended. Along
the sky the rockets and star shells blazed and spluttered,
lighting us for the moment, and then leaving the darkness
still more oppressive around us. It took much pushing
and shoving to get the "Petit Camerade" on to the
roadway, and our hosts bade us good-bye heartily, though
in whispers, as we were very near the "movement along
the front."</p>

MIDSHIPMAN'S
LOG</h2></div>

<p><i>Told by a Dartmouth Student (Name Suppressed)</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the narrative of a boy who was a midshipman in the
Dardanelles Campaign. The mobilization of the Dartmouth
Cadets is tragic evidence of the grim facts of War. The loss
of these boys on the ill-fated <i>Cressy</i>, the <i>Aboukir</i>, and the
<i>Hogue</i>, brought an outburst of protest in parliament. This midshipman
describes among his adventures: "The Scenes When
the Students Left Dartmouth College"; "The Voyage from
Egypt to Mombasa"; "The Bombardment of Dar-es-Salaam";
"Ordered to the Dardanelles," and "The Sinking of the Ship."

<p><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
I&mdash;STORY OF THE SINKING OF THE SHIP</p>

<p>Crash!&mdash;Bang!&mdash;Cr-r-ash! I woke with a start, and
sitting up in my hammock gazed around to see what had
so suddenly roused me. Some of the midshipmen were
already standing on the deck in their pyjamas&mdash;others,
like me, were sitting up half dazed with sleep. A party
of ship's boys crowded up the ladder from the gun-room
flat, followed by three officers; one of these, a sub-lieutenant
R.N.R., called out: "Keep calm, and you'll all be
saved."</p>

<p>Up to that moment it had never dawned upon me that
the ship was sinking, and even then I thought it improbable
until I noticed that we were already listing to starboard.
Then I got up and walked up the hatch to the
quarter-deck. The ship was now heeling about five degrees
to starboard, and I climbed up to the port side. It
was nearly pitch dark. A seaman rushing to help lower
the boats charged into me, and I turned and swore at
him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
<p>Gradually a crowd gathered along the port side. "Boat
ahoy! Boat ahoy!" They yelled; but, as the ship listed
more and more, and there was no sign or sound of any
approaching vessel, the men's voices seemed to get a bit
hopeless. The Commander was urging on a gang who
were trying to get some heavy timber overboard; but, as
we listed further and further over, they found it impossible
to get it up on the port side and couldn't get round
to starboard, as the capstan and the Captain's hatch and
skylight were in the way. At last they gave it up, and
going to the side joined their voices to those of the crew,
who were trying to attract the attention of any vessel
that might be in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Inside the ship everything which was not secured was
sliding about and bringing up against the bulkheads with
a series of crashes. Crockery was smashing&mdash;boats
falling out of their crutches&mdash;broken funnel-guys swinging
against the funnel casings. She had heeled over to
about twenty degrees, then she stopped and remained
steady for a few seconds. In the momentary lull the
voice of one of our officers rang out steady and clear
as at "divisions": "Keep calm, men. Be British!"</p>

<p>Then the ship started to heel rapidly again, and I felt
sure there was no chance of saving her. I turned to jump
overboard. The Commander, who was standing a few
paces away on my right, went over a second before me.
Raising my arms above my head I sprang well out board
and dived. Just before I struck the water my face hit the
side of the ship. It was a horrid feeling sliding on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
face down the slimy side, and a second later I splashed
in with tremendous force, having dived about thirty
feet.</p>

<p>Just as I was rising to the surface again a heavy body
came down on top of me. I fought clear and rose rather
breathless and bruised. I swam about fifty yards away,
to get clear of the suction when the ship went down;
then, turning round and treading water, I watched her
last moments. The noise of crashing furniture and
smashing crockery was continuous. Slowly her stern
lifted until it was dimly outlined against the deep midnight
sky. Slowly her bows slid further and further
under until, with a final lurch, she turned completely over
and disappeared bottom upwards in a mass of bubbles.</p>

<p>She had been our home for nearly ten months&mdash;she
was gone&mdash;vanished&mdash;in less than four minutes.</p>


<p>II&mdash;OVERBOARD&mdash;A SWIM FOR LIFE</p>

<p>Turning over and swimming a slow side-stroke I made
for <i>H.M.S. Cornwallis</i>, which I could discern faintly silhouetted
against the sky about two-and-a-half miles distant.
Suddenly something touched my leg, and the
thought of the sharks we had watched from the bridge
the previous afternoon flashed shudderingly across my
mind&mdash;but it was only a floating potato! Soon the
shrieks of the drowning grew faint in the distance and I
swam on with three others near me. When I had been
in the water for about twenty minutes I looked up and
saw what I thought to be a boat. I shouted out, "Boat
ahoy!"&mdash;and turning on my side swam for some time a
fast side-stroke. When at last I rested and looked for
the imagined boat, which ought to have been quite near
by now, I discovered that I had somehow misfocussed the
<i>Cornwallis</i>, and so come to imagine she was a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
steamboat quite close instead of a battle-ship a mile and a
half away. However, I felt quite confident of reaching
her if only I persevered, so I continued to swim a slow
side-stroke. Soon after this my pyjama jacket came
undone, and I took it off as it hindered me. A few minutes
later I sighted a huge spar about twenty feet long,
probably the topgallant mast or lower boom from our
ship. It must have been thrown a tremendous way by
the force of the explosion to be so far down the channel.
The current was very strong, and of course that was a
great help to those who were swimming. I hung on to
the spar for a minute or two to get my breath back a bit,
and rubbed myself all over in order to restore the circulation,
as by that time I was getting very cold. After a
short rest I started off again to try and reach H.M.S.
<i>Cornwallis</i>. Presently it seemed to me that I was not
approaching her as rapidly as before, and almost at the
same moment she switched on her searchlights, when I
saw by their light that she was out of the main stream
of the current, and that to reach her I should have to
swim half a mile absolutely unaided by the flow of the
tide. I tried to get in the beam of her searchlight, thinking
she would be sure to have some boats out and that
they would see me; but I found I was unable to manage
this, and after about five minutes I gave up trying. Then
I turned round and looked about for some other ship to
essay and make for. About a quarter of a mile behind
me, and slightly up stream, I saw another ship with all
her searchlights going and I determined to try and reach
her. I swam towards her, and presently saw two steamboats
push off from her bow and make up stream for the
scene of the disaster, but they were too far off to hail.
Five minutes later I heard the welcome plash of oars,
and looking to my left saw a cutter approaching with a
man in the bows sweeping the surrounding water with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
hand lantern. I yelled out, "Boat ahoy!" and back came
the cheering answer: "All right, we're coming. Hang
on!"</p>

<p>A minute later the lantern flashed in my face, a pair of
strong arms grasped me by the shoulders and hauled me
clear of the water.</p>

<p>I must have fainted then, for I remember nothing
more until I became dimly conscious as in a dream that
I was in the stern sheets of a boat lying alongside some
other vessel. A man's voice said, "Here's a midshipman,
sir," and next moment I was picked up and set down on
the deck.</p>

<p>Barely conscious as yet of my surroundings, I was
taken into a sort of cabin, where I was given some neat
rum. It was very fiery and nearly choked me, but it
bucked me up a bit all the same. Then I was conducted
down to the boiler-room, where some one stripped off
my pyjama trousers (my one remaining garment), and
I sat down on a locker before the furnace and soon got a
degree of warmth back into my body.</p>

<p>Presently I heard the voice of one of our lieutenants
speaking up above, and called out to him to know how
he'd come off. Then I was helped up the gangway again
and into a small sort of saloon in the stern. Here I was
given some more rum, a very large sweater, and a pair of
blue serge trousers belonging to one of the crew, and
when I had put them on I lay down in a bunk and immediately
fell asleep. About an hour later I woke up
and found the saloon full of officers and men.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant to whom I had spoken in the boiler-room
was sitting at the table. He was dressed in a jersey
and a seaman's duck trousers. Two other survivors, a
marine and an armourer, were also at the table, and
across the saloon in the bunk opposite mine lay a gunner's
mate. I asked the Lieutenant what time our ship was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
struck. He said his watch had stopped at 1.29 a.m.,
when he jumped into the sea, and so he presumed we
were torpedoed at about 1.27, as the ship only took <i>three
and a half minutes</i> to go down. She had been struck on
the starboard side by three torpedoes fired from a Turkish
torpedo-boat, which had drifted down the straits keeping
close inshore, and thus eluded our destroyer patrol.
To give the enemy his due it was a jolly smart piece of
work.</p>


<p>III&mdash;RESCUED&mdash;THE BURIALS AT SEA</p>

<p>It was now somewhere about 3.30 a.m., and, as I did
not feel inclined to sleep any more, they gave me some
hot cocoa and some bread-and-cheese. I drank the former,
but the bread-and-cheese was more than I felt equal
to just then. About 6 o'clock the Lieutenant was transferred
to another ship for medical treatment, as his back
was badly bruised by drifting wreckage; and half-an-hour
later the rest of the survivors were re-embarked in
H.M.S. <i>Lord Nelson's</i> cutter, the same that had picked
us up; and leaving the trawler she took us to the <i>Lord
Nelson</i>.</p>

<p>When we got on board I was at once taken down to
the gun-room, where I found four more of our "snotties"
who had also been rescued. One more was reported as
having safely swum ashore; but there was no news of the
other three, and subsequently it transpired that they had
been lost.</p>

<p>The survivors were mostly sleeping&mdash;the sleep of exhaustion.
We had all had a pretty tough fight for it,
and I realised then how uncommonly lucky we had been
in escaping not only alive, but for the most part uninjured.
Cunninghame had a nasty cut on his head, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the rest of us were only suffering from minor bruises,
and of course to a certain extent from shock.</p>

<p>One of the <i>Lord Nelson's</i> middies kindly lent me some
old uniform, and after I had dressed I made a parcel of
the clothes I had been lent on the trawler and took them
to the ship's corporal, and asked him to see that they
were returned to their owner.</p>

<p>I remembered, with an odd sense of unreality, that the
last time I had been in the <i>Lord Nelson</i> was at the
man&oelig;uvres the previous July!</p>

<p>On my way up to the deck I met three more of our
lieutenants, and we exchanged accounts of our experiences.
From them I learned that our Commander had
been saved, and was also on board; but there was no
news of the Captain. Some days later I heard that his
body had been picked up, and it was thought that he had
been killed by the falling of the pinnace when the ship
turned over just before she sank.</p>

<p>At 7.30 we put to sea and proceeded to Port Mudros.
On the way, and after divisions, the lower deck was
cleared, the whole ship's company, together with the survivors
from our ship, mustered on the quarter-deck, and
then took place a mournful ceremony, which poignantly
brought home to us the fate we had so narrowly escaped.</p>

<p>Through the battery&mdash;very softly&mdash;came the sound of
muffled drums, growing gradually louder as the band advanced.
Then appeared a procession of seamen from
our lost ship, headed by the <i>Lord Nelson's</i> chaplain, and
carrying three stretchers, on each of which lay a body
covered with the Union Jack. The first was that of our
Fleet paymaster, and the other two those of a seaman
and marine respectively. The bodies were lifted from
the stretchers and laid reverently on a platform slanting
towards the water, which had been erected on the port
side. Clearly and solemnly the chaplain recited the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Burial Service, and as he uttered the words "we
therefore commit their bodies to the deep," the staging
was tilted and the weighted corpses slid feet foremost into
the sea.</p>

<p>The service ended with three volleys fired over the
side and then the long sobbing wail of the "Last Post"
rang out across the still waters in final farewell.</p>

<p>When we were dismissed we went below in silence,
awed by the solemnity of this last committal to the deep
of those with whom we had lived and worked side by side
for ten long months.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(The midshipman here describes his voyage home,
closing with this expostulation from his mother: "I had
not seen him since he left Dartmouth nearly fourteen
months before. Then he was a round-faced, rosy boy.
Up the steps, dragging a seaman's canvas kit bag came
a tall, thin figure, white of face, drawn, haggard&mdash;incredibly
old. I had not quite realized this. For a second
my heart stood still&mdash;where was my boy? Then he
saw me waiting in the hall and his face lit with half
credulous joyous wonder, 'Mother! you here!' My boy
was gone forever&mdash;but my son had come home.")</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="nobreak">HORRORS OF TRENCH FIGHTING&mdash;WITH
THE CANADIAN HEROES</h2></div>

<p><i>Remarkable Experiences of an American
Soldier</i></p>

<p><i>Told by Roméo Houle, of the First Canadian Division</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This story reveals in all its realism the reason why America
entered the Great War&mdash;to save the world from the suffering
herein described. Every American who reads this story will
be aroused as never before against the German War despots
who forced this horror upon civilization. To bring this war
to an end the Americans crossed the seas to fight with the
Allies&mdash;and save humanity. This true story of the trenches is
undeniably one of the most thrilling human documents that the
great struggle has produced. Roméo Houle was born in New
Bedford, Mass., Oct. 29th, 1893, the son of a local barber,
Zacharie Houle, and Xeline Bagnoche. He has a common school
education. He moved to Montreal in 1912, where he was a
barber. When war was declared he enlisted in the Sixty-fifth
Regiment, First Canadian Division, Aug. 10, 1914. His father
secured the young soldier's discharge through Congressman
Walsh of Massachusetts on the ground that he was an American
citizen and was not of age when he enlisted. He made
notes of his experiences while in the trenches, and the subjoined
production was written by him for <i>Current History</i> in
collaboration with his friend Arthur L. Bouvier, editor of a
French newspaper at New Haven.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;TRUE STORY OF THE "GERMAN PLAGUE"</p>

<p>The true story of the trenches has never been told. I
know, because for many months I have lived in trenches.
I have slept daily in dread of bullet, shrapnel, mine, and
deadly gas; and nightly in fear of mine and gas&mdash;and
the man-eating rats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>I am one of the few soldiers living who entered the
front trenches at the opening of the war and who lived
to fight the Germans in the front trenches in February,
1916. Of my original company (the Fourth of the Fourteenth
Battalion, Third Brigade, First Canadian Division),
which marched away to that hell at Laventie and
Ypres so gaily&mdash;500 brave boys&mdash;I am one of the sixteen
who survive....</p>

<p>Who has seen hell? Who has experienced the horrors
of Milton's terrible vision or the slow tortures of Dante's
inferno? God! If Dante's dream madness were truth,
and those seven circles were seven encircling battle lines
in Northern France or the torn fringe of brave little
Belgium, I could stand up and say there is no agony of
body or mind which I have not seen, which I have not
experienced. I thank God and give Him the glory that
I still am sane. Gas? What do you know of it, you people
who never heard earth and heaven rock with the
frantic turmoil of the ceaseless bombardment? A crawling
yellow cloud that pours in upon you, that gets you
by the throat and shakes you as a huge mastiff might
shake a kitten, and leaves you burning in every nerve and
vein of your body with pain unthinkable; your eyes starting
from their sockets; your face turned yellow-green.</p>

<p>Rats? What did you ever read of the rats in the
trenches? Next to gas, they still slide on their fat bellies
through my dreams. Poe could have got new inspiration
from their dirty hordes. Rats, rats, rats&mdash;I see them
still, slinking from new meals on corpses, from Belgium
to the Swiss Alps. Rats, rats, rats, tens of thousands of
rats, crunching between battle lines while the rapid-firing
guns mow the trench edge&mdash;crunching their hellish feasts.
Full fed, slipping and sliding down into the wet trenches
they swarm at night&mdash;and more than one poor wretch
has had his face eaten off by them while he slept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Stench? Did you ever breathe air foul with the gases
arising from a thousand rotting corpses? Dirt? Have
you ever fought half madly through days and nights and
weeks unwashed, with feverish rests between long hours
of agony, while the guns boom their awful symphony of
death, and the bullets zip-zip-zip ceaselessly along the
trench edge that is your skyline&mdash;and your deathline,
too, if you stretch and stand upright?...</p>

<p>You wouldn't believe all I have seen, all I have left.
Ah, no; you would say, "Roméo Houle, you are lying,"
were I to tell you some unbelievable things that I have
really lived through. Men go mad over there. When
you know what life in the first-line trenches is like you
will wonder that I have returned, and that, having returned,
I am still in my right mind. Sometimes, at night,
I find myself again carrying the wounded back after the
charge, and listening to dying soldiers telling me to look
into blood-soaked pockets for last letters to their sweethearts
or mothers back home. "Tell mother that I received
the Blessed Sacrament before the battle began."
I hear their breaking voices whisper, "Tell mother,"
while the thundering artillery pours its curtain of fire
upon us, and our boys throw back from their rude, handmade
sling shots their deadly "jam-pots." "Tell mother!"
I think all the battle front is crying now those words.
O Mother of God, hear them and end this needless butchery!</p>

<p>I fought at Ypres. I fought at St. Julien. I fought at
Lacouture and Festubert. I fought at Cuinchy. I
fought at Givenchy and La Bassée, and in the first-line
trenches at Messines. And before all these I fought in
the first line at Richebourg and Laventie, and I live, one
of 16 alive out of 500.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>


<p>II&mdash;AN AMERICAN WHO WENT "OVER
THERE"</p>

<p>I am an American by birth and a barber by occupation.
I have shaved men for my living in New Bedford,
Mass., and have shaved soldiers of necessity in time to
the cracking of rifles in Northern France. I chanced to
be in Montreal when England declared war. That was
on Aug. 4, 1914. On Aug. 10 I enlisted in the Sixty-fifth
Regiment of French Canadians commanded by
Major Barre of Montreal. There were two New England
boys with me in the regiment&mdash;Henri Bertrand of
Attleboro and a fellow named Collette from New Bedford.
There were 500 French Canadians&mdash;then&mdash;between
the ages of 18 and 28. I left most of them buried in unmarked
graves.</p>

<p>We left Montreal on Aug. 25 for Valcartier, where
they made out of a fair barber a good soldier, I think.
The Duke and Duchess of Connaught inspected us at
Valcartier, and a brave sight we were in our new uniforms
and our full and gallant ranks. But the Duke and
Duchess would have shuddered could they have inspected
us, say at Cuinchy or Messines. Our 500 got thinner
the older the war grew. Our 500 will be gone, I think,
all gone but me, before the war is over. I'd be gone, too,
but for Congressman Walsh and the American Government,
which, after all, is mine, and the one I'd best die
for, if die I must for any. It was on Sept. 25 that I
sailed with my regiment for Plymouth, England, on board
the Cunarder <i>Alunia</i>. There were 1,000 men on board,
half English, half French.</p>

<p>Thirty-three vessels sailed together in three rows of
eleven boats each, with three cruisers to left and three
to right of us, and one before and one behind to guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
us. So great was our dread of German torpedoes and
mines, it took us twenty-one days to cross.</p>

<p>I was in the Seventh and Eighth Companies of this
French Canadian regiment, the Sixty-fifth, but at the
front my company was known as the Fourth of the
Fourteenth Battalion, Third Brigade, First Canadian Division.
The <i>Alunia</i> was the second to land at Plymouth,
and the whole town turned out to give us a reception,
with houses decorated and flags flying&mdash;for 484 of us a
death bridal, indeed! Three days later we were reviewed
by Lord Roberts on Salisbury Plain, and the King also
inspected us. Thence we marched to Larkhill, where we
remained until Feb. 12, 1915. Then we left for France.</p>

<p>First came St. Nazaire; then Hazebrouck, and a twelve-mile
hike to Fletre, a village in the north. We had a
two-days' rest, and marched twenty-four miles to Armentières.
At Armentières I first entered a trench. We
trained there with English troops. And we lay shivering
in the rain for forty-eight hours, and then gladly left for
Richebourg, three miles away.</p>

<p>At Richebourg we entered trenches of our own. There
Charles Lapointe of Montreal, the first of our company
to die, looked over the edge of the trench. That is
death. Machine guns all day sweep the trench edges.
If you raise your hand, your fingers will be cut off as
by a knife. And once I saw a poor wretch, weary almost
to death of the trench, raise his right arm at full length.
He was sent home, maimed and in agony, as he had
wished. And who can say that his act was cowardly?
He who has lived in the trenches for weeks and months
knows. The soldier had courage to raise his hand. Perhaps
some who clung to the mud at the trench bottom
were greater cowards than he.</p>

<p>Well, Lapointe looked over the trench edge; and nobody
knows what he saw. His brother was there to lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
him down. He buried him (as we ever must the dead
at the front) in a shallow pit in our trench. And the
brother had for a time the agony of having to fight and
feel the earth give over Charley's breast.</p>

<p>Two miles from there, at Laventie, we fought in the
first line again. A German shell exploded over a pile of
brush in a field near where I was shooting toward the
German line. And we, weary of the monotony of the
fighting, were overjoyed to see the ground covered far
and wide with potatoes, which some farmer had hidden
under hay. Potatoes! We blessed our periscope for the
toothsome vision. And, marvelous to relate, we noted
that the German fire slackened. Our officers could not
restrain the French Canadians. On our bellies, over the
death line we crawled unscathed, and, flat on the ground,
wriggled to the potatoes, braving death for what we deem
so common in America.</p>

<p>I got my share. Nor did the flaming sky pour upon
us the leaden hail we feared, for the Germans held their
fire while we gathered the crop we did not plant.</p>

<p>Toward night, in the dusk, we discovered by our spectroscope
that the German boys, who were cold in their
trenches, were demolishing a house for firewood, an old
cottage, the property, perhaps, of that very peasant who
had hidden our potatoes under the hay. We had their
lives in our hands. We remembered our Irish feast&mdash;and
word went down the line to hold our fire. Nor did one
German die.</p>

<p>That was the Golden Rule of the battle front.</p>


<p>III&mdash;"MY FIRST NIGHT UNDER FIRE"</p>

<p>I slept in my blanket, my first night under fire, with a
lump of cheese at my feet, as a bribe to the rats to spare
my face. Not that I slept much. The night rocked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
sound. The night is the true time for fighting, and the
wire-cutters were creeping about on their dangerous errands
between the trenches. The rockets now and then
hissed skyward, throwing their powerful flares of light
over the darkened world. Wounded men groaned. And
rats, like flies in Summer, scuttled about, making queer
noises, which we could hear in momentary lulls. I had
not lain there long before an officer called for volunteers
to examine the land between our trench and the enemy's
and repair our broken barbed wire entanglements. The
wires are destroyed every day by the bombardment, and
must be repaired every night. It is a most dangerous
duty. Yet, I gladly volunteer, with Aurele, Auguste, and
other friends.</p>

<p>While we were at work upon the wires the Germans
threw up some flares and turned our protecting darkness
into the glare of midday. They poured upon us a deadly
fire. We dropped among the dead bodies which littered
the ground. And long I lay, sprawled across the corpse
of some brave German lad killed there many days before&mdash;constrained
to feign death to save my life. But we
did not all escape. Martin of Montreal was killed and
many of our little party were wounded. But, as usual, I
came back at last, moving painfully on my stomach, uninjured.
I reported to Captain Desserre and told him all
that I had heard and seen. And then I went back to
sleep upon empty sandbags; and a cold, cold night it was.</p>

<p>I awoke at 7 o'clock, sore and stiff. I soon had kindled
a little fire and cooked a slice of bacon and steeped a
little tea for my chum, Aurele Roy of Montreal, and myself.</p>

<p>"I can lick the whole German Army alone this morning!"
I exclaimed in French, warmed by the tea.</p>

<p>"Not alone!" cried Roy, reviving also under the influence
of our breakfast, "for if you begin to lick 'em,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
I'll be beside you." And we laughed together, little
dreaming how soon our brave words would be put to
the test.</p>

<p>I did my turn at guard duty almost cheerfully. I
cleaned my rifle and bayonet, shaved myself, and washed
up a little, and then thought I would get a little more rest
while I could. But, alas, some one had stolen my two
empty sandbags! So I took off my overcoat and spread
it on the ground and covered myself with a blanket. The
sun meanwhile was shining hotly on the heaps of dead
bodies which lay not far away outside the trench. I was
glad to cover my head with a blanket to shut out some
of the awful stench. And that is how the smell of decaying
bodies saved my life.</p>

<p>Arthur Robillard, a car conductor back in Montreal,
was on guard duty. I was roused when he fell over me.
As I sat up something got me by the throat and began
to strangle out my life. The air was rent with awful
cries. Many of my comrades lay dying and dead about
me. I hurled myself in semi-madness into a huge crater
near by, made by a bursting shell. There was a little
muddy water at the bottom, and I fell in it, face down.</p>

<p>The water relieved me a little, and I wet my handkerchief
in it and covered my face. The green, stinking
air was thus shut out, and I began to breathe easier. I
crawled out, and half blindly sought my unconscious
chum, dragging him back ten yards into the crater where
the water was. I laid him face downward there, and he,
too, revived a little, and there we lay, waiting for death.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, I heard a shouting, and knew that
the Germans were coming fast. Then I ran back into
my trench, got my gun, and began firing as fast as I could.
The rifle soon became so hot that it burned my hands.
I threw it down and began throwing bombs. The order
to retreat to the next trench came. My half-strangled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
comrade was with me. We ran together and, looking
back, saw the big, strapping gray fellows of the Teuton
army leaping down into our trench.</p>

<p>I forgot the rheumatism from which I had been suffering
for several days when I saw them come, (we all suffer
from rheumatism, it is one of the curses of the trenches).
Meanwhile, the French had retired to their fourth line,
and we were left, almost surrounded, with our left flank
exposed and annihilation threatening us.</p>

<p>Somehow we got hold of two machine-guns, and placed
them where they would do the most good. One of these
was running 560 shots a minute, and the other&mdash;blessed
French destroyer!&mdash;was pouring out death at the rate of
700 shots a minute.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;"I SHALL NEVER FORGET THOSE
GERMANS"</p>

<p>I shall never forget those Germans. When our guns
suddenly spoke their front line melted; their second
crumpled before this destruction; but on, on, on they
came, unflinching, marching with even steps into certain
death. We were like lions at bay. It was our lives or
the Germans'. Then, as fourteen of us fought together,
a bomb dropped amid us, and killed eleven. I came to
consciousness, lying in the bottom of a trench, with Roy
leaning over me.</p>

<p>"Are you living, Roméo!" he exclaimed in amazement.
I rose dizzily. He and I and one other stood alone among
our eleven dead friends.</p>

<p>Then Roy told me that I had been blown clear of the
trench, twenty feet from where I stood, and that he had
braved death to secure, as he supposed, my dead body.
A careful examination showed that my only injury was
a terrible bruise on the calf of my leg, where the round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
surface of a flying shard had struck me, but without
breaking the skin. Miracles are but small matters when
you fight in the presence of death.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid now," I told Roy. And from then on
I and all my soldier friends believed my life was charmed
and that the Germans could not kill me.</p>

<p>We were driven back before their heavy guns to the
fourth line, and were almost immediately told in haste to
leave it as quickly as we could. Our engineers had mined
the place, and as we fled the Germans poured down a
gray horde of men. So we blew them up.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a thousand men hurled to atoms
by a giant blast? I cannot forget that awful sight. The
whole earth seemed to leap skyward, and through and
through the black mountain of earth and stones shot
heads and arms and legs, torn fragments of what were
once heroic men. Next to the gas which they gave us,
I think our blowing them up like this was surely the worst
thing men could do to men.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have heard of the friendship which often
springs up between the Allies and their foes. I know
something about it. It was at Laventie that the Germans
began to amuse themselves by putting a bullseye on a
biscuit box and letting us use it for a target. We then
returned the compliment and set up a similar bullseye for
the Teuton boys. For between Germans and Allies as individuals,
there is no hate, though I must except the
treacherous German prisoner I had to kill to save my
life.</p>

<p>Every time the Germans made a bullseye, I would raise
a shovel. If they missed, I put up a handkerchief. They
did the same for us. And so we who sought each other's
lives played together, and death spoke sharply all around.</p>

<p>Sergeant Pichette was a wag. He put an old derby
on a stick and ran along the trench as if it were a man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and the Germans fired at it. He would pull the hat down
occasionally to make the enemy believe that the man
under it had been shot, but soon afterward he would
raise it again, thereby causing much amusement.</p>

<p>We used to talk back and forth&mdash;those German boys
and we Canadians. They were the 157th and most
friendly. "Hi! Where do you come from?" a voice
in French once called over to us.</p>

<p>"We are French Canadians," we replied with pride.</p>

<p>"Well, we're Canadians, too," came the astonishing answer.
"We come from Ontario."</p>

<p>There came a pause. There was no firing. Then the
German shouted, "Let me see one of your group; let
him stand above the trench, and on my word of honor
we shall not fire."</p>

<p>One of us sprang out of the trench and stood up.
There fell a deep silence upon the two armies. Then
many stood up, and finally the Germans, too, were rising.
We talked for hours so, when the officers were not looking.
When they looked we did a deal of firing&mdash;but our
aim was much too high.</p>

<p>One day the Germans threw over a bit of paper
wrapped around a stone. "If you don't fire on us, we
won't fire on you," some one had written. We kept
that strange pact for days, until the officers, discovering
this pact of peace, moved us to another part of the
trenches.</p>

<p>Some months later, curiously enough, we found ourselves
opposite the same regiment. Neither side forgot
we were both Canadian, and steadfastly kept our treaty
of peace. They did not consider that rough note a
"scrap of paper." Not a single shot was fired and only
one man was killed, and he by a stray bullet.</p>

<p>Because friendships started easily between hostile bodies,
they kept moving a regiment from one part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
trenches to another, that we might not get too friendly
with our enemies. We had no heart in the butchery,
Germans or we French Canadians.</p>


<p>V&mdash;"WE CRAWL FORTH TO DEATH"</p>

<p>A big part of trench warfare is the mining operations.
I feared the mines more than anything, I think. It was
more terrible than gas poisoning to think that at any
moment the earth would be rent and you would be thrown
a thousand ways at once. The mining operations were
carried on by trained miners, who burrow along under
ground about fifteen feet below the surface. The engineers
in charge figure out just how far they must dig
to reach positions under the German lines, and when they
have done so a fuse is run in&mdash;and Fritz and Hans and
their friends jump fifty feet toward heaven.</p>

<p>We do this; the Germans do it. It is bad work. And
on both sides, we have to keep men listening all the time
for the digging. When it is discovered that a mine is
coming our way, we sink a tunnel deeper still and blow
up their tunnel. And the Germans do the same thing with
our mines. The soldier in the trench never knows when
he may be blown into small pieces&mdash;and that is why we
always preferred to risk uncertain dangers between the
lines at night, instead of lying down in the wet trench,
helplessly waiting for death.</p>

<p>I never felt so secure, indeed, as when I was on guard
between the trenches, through all the night I could hear
the bullets go over me....</p>

<p>And I have seen men of good health grow so weary of
the trenches that they have simply stood up at noon-day.
Some machine-guns swiftly ended them. And others, as
I have written, simply stick up their hands above the
trench top and bullets trim off their fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>I was twenty days at Laventie. We only had the
regular rifle shooting there, and were fortunate in losing
not a single man of our 500 by bombs. We then marched
to a point about one mile to the right of the now famous
Neuve Chapelle, where we caught the Germans by surprise
and took nearly 3,000 prisoners.</p>

<p>For two days and two nights I was firing continuously.
My rifle became so hot that I had to fill my hands with
dirt before firing. The fighting became so fierce that we
had to employ men to do nothing else but carry ammunition
to us from 200 yards in the rear. We were two
and one-half miles to the left of the British. The Germans,
but for us, could have got reinforcements, but we
Canadians were in the way. We expected, at first, to attack
them, as they were only sixty yards away. We had
constructed special bridges to cross a ten-yard stream
near by. Our work was to fire upon the German reserves
in the rear, and this we easily did, because our guns carried
for two miles. The Germans were defeated largely
because they supposed the British had plenty of reinforcements.</p>

<p>The whole thing began suddenly at 2:30 in the morning,
after a quiet day. It was an earthquake. Our company
until then had fought in no real battle and had lost
only five men. Other companies used to declare that we
had some guardian angel to protect us. Anyhow, many
say that I had some guardian angel to protect me&mdash;and
I am sure that I did.</p>

<p>Three men volunteered to go and cut the wire entanglements.
Bullets were humming through the air. They
crawled forth&mdash;to their deaths, we thought&mdash;but succeeded
in cutting nearly all. So the Germans thought
we were about to attack them. As soon as the Germans
discovered what our men had done, we poured a withering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
fire over the broken wires, so that no man could live
to reach and repair them.</p>

<p>The English bombarded the Germans for two whole
days. Then we heard cries, and fast by us went the
Black Watch, a Scotch regiment, and the Coldstream
Guards. It was between 4 and 5 in the morning that
they passed us, and within ten minutes they had captured
the three first lines of the Germans.</p>

<p>The Germans lost 25,000 men and 3,000 prisoners.
Our loss was between 10,000 and 12,000. Two days
later troops came to relieve us, and in time, for we were
well-nigh exhausted. We marched at night to Estaires,
a pretty village eight miles away. Our men were so
worn out that they dropped from weariness on the way.
We spent eight days in this town and were royally treated
by the French.</p>

<p>At midnight of the eighth day we were warned to get
ready for marching again. We walked twenty-seven
kilometers to Cassel, where General Dorrien, who was
in charge of the battle when the English retreated from
Mons in France, in the early part of the war, told us
that he was going to take charge of the whole Canadian
division, and that our regiment would be transferred to
another army corps. He gave us three days' rest, and
told us we were to occupy French trenches at Ypres.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;"WHAT I SAW AT YPRES"</p>

<p>Ypres is the graveyard of the old Sixty-fifth. We
were carried to within six miles of the place in London
buses, twenty-five men in a bus. Ypres was forty miles
away. We met there the Canadian Scottish Third Brigade
of 5,000 men. From the end of the bus line we
tramped six miles and encamped outside the village of
St. Julien, one mile away. Two battalions were in reserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
at St. Jean and two were in the front line, mine being one
of the two at the front.</p>

<p>It was at Ypres that we first met the gallant French
troops. My company was on the left of the English line,
so that we acted as interpreters between the French and
the English. A roadway ten yards wide separated the
two lines and a tunnel ran from the English to the French
lines.</p>

<p>We found the trenches here to be forty yards from the
German line and in bad condition. Firing was continuous,
by day and by night. The communication trenches
were in bad shape, too, and the Germans, who were on a
height, raked us terribly with their machine-guns. I
looked through my periscope and saw between 400 and
500 unburied German dead lying between the lines. I
counted 25 dead Frenchmen among them. Three months
before, I was told, the Germans had tried to carry the
line and neither side had given the other a chance to bury
its dead.</p>

<p>Our French neighbors were Zouaves, between 19 and
30 years of age, and the gayest soldiers I have ever fought
beside. They sang gay ditties and called us French Canadians
"Frères." We spent our nights in throwing
grenades at the Boches and our days in the slow monotony
of every-day trench life.</p>

<p>I rose at noon, the day after our arrival, and took the
time to shave, a rare event. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon,
at one mile from us, we saw yellow smoke rising
from the ground. This smoke was the deadly gas being
thrown upon the French and upon the Scotch regiment
that had taken our places while we were resting, for, of
course, we were resting when I shaved. We formed at
once in light marching order and went to help the Scotch.</p>

<p>We entered the reserve trench, and at midnight the
first-line trench. The Scotch had lost half of their effectives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and were returning with the French, the blood
streaming from their mouths and noses, and their faces
all yellow-green. The French had lost nearly all their
regiment. The Germans within five minutes had occupied
our first and second lines.</p>

<p>In half an hour the Boches began a great bombardment.
At 7 o'clock they tried to take our line, repeating
their attacks all the night, but we rolled them back. They
came even to within ten yards of us, a flood of human
waves. But our machine-guns, our "coffee grinders,"
as we called them, mowed them down like hay, and we
lost not many men.</p>

<p>Our artillery had plenty of ammunition. Our light
guns were placed at 400 yards from the front line and
the heavy artillery at one and a half miles, and some
pieces as far as four miles away. The famous French
Africans, called Senegalese, were fighting here with us.
The Boches set fire to the City of Ypres in the night, and
I watched its sullen glare against the sky. The civilian
populace went running by, in dreadful condition. That
night, of my friends, died Vaillant, Poitras, and Bond,
all of Montreal, and two others. Poirer and Lefebre of
Montreal and O. Wiseman, also my friends, had been
killed during the day. Yet I lived!</p>

<p>Ypres was a famous battle, one of the greatest of the
war, I think, till this terrible onslaught at Verdun. Our
division (Canadian) reached from Ypres (Belgium) to
Poelcappelle Road. At 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, before the gas overtook
me, I was sent out between the lines with another man
to examine the wire entanglements. We heard a sound
as of some one handling pipes, but discovered nothing
more. Then the Boches sent up their flares (skyrockets
whose bursting bombs turned night into daylight) and we
lay on the ground motionless. In the darkness which
followed, we crept back over the heaps of dead toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
our line. When I had almost reached the trench, another
great flare burst right over us, and I had to lie still
for several moments until the welcome darkness gave
me an opportunity to drop into the trench again.</p>

<p>Men were dying from the gas, their eyes popping,
their faces green, and crying: "Water! Water! I'm
choking! Air! Air! Air!" It is a frightful thing to hear
your friends crying like that. I saw one die right before
my eyes, rolling upon the ground as if mad, tearing at
his chest. His fingers were crooked after his death, his
body full of blue spots and his mouth white. Another
poor wretch fell two or three feet from me, dying from
the gas. He was sucking water from a dirty handkerchief.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;THIS IS WHAT THE GERMANS FORCED
UPON THE WORLD</p>

<p>Listen. Suppose you were fighting in a trench. The
wind comes toward you, foul with odors from nameless,
twisted, torn bodies unburied between you and the
Boches. Near you are your brave comrades. Some lie
wounded and dying in agony on the trench bottom. The
bullets zing-zing eternally over your head. There is a
mighty swelling from an organ more sonorous than ever
human organist played. The rockets are bursting; the
flares shedding white glares over the torn ground. Your
coffee grinders are mowing them down.</p>

<p>Then, rising from somewhere near by, comes the gas,
yellow or green. Then comes a sudden stinging in your
nose. Your eyes water and run. You breathe fire. You
suffocate. You burn alive. There are razors and needles
in your throat. It is as if you drank boiling hot tea.
Your lungs flame. You want to scratch and tear your
body. You become half blind, half wild. Your head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
aches beyond description, you vomit, you drop exhausted,
you die quickly.</p>

<p>Every other man seemed to fall. As I fought I marveled
that I was spared. And again came to me the belief
that my life was charmed; that the bullet had not been
melted, the shrapnel not been loaded, the gas not mixed
which would cause my death. An ecstatic confidence
buoyed me up. I was brave, because I was so sure of
life, while all my comrades seemed groveling in death.</p>

<p>My platoon was under a withering fire, before which
we crumpled and melted away. We left the trench,
pressing forward. All hell seemed to rise suddenly from
the bowels of the earth and pour over us flame and molten
lead. The ground seethed from the exploding shells.
The mitrailleuses vomited death.</p>

<p>Our thinned lines gave a yell. I saw a black hole
in the ground. Sergeant Albert Pichette shouted, "Into
their trench!" I leaped in. Four Germans were trying
to escape on the further side. I did not fire, intending
to make them prisoners. But the only thing I took was
a great blow on the side of my head, and away went
my prisoners.</p>

<p>I crawled up the trench a few feet and came upon two
men trying to strangle each other. I thought, then, of
motion pictures I had watched back home. Here was a
more terrible drama than ever the movie camera showed.</p>

<p>A bayonet charge is a street fight magnified and made
ten thousand times more fierce. It becomes on close range
almost impossible to use your bayonets. So we fought
with fists and feet, and used our guns, when possible, as
clubs. We lay in our prize trench for about four hours.
The boys, excited because they still lived, sang and
jested, and told of queer experiences and narrow escapes
they had had.</p>

<p>By 10 o'clock came the story that the British had lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
four field guns and asked our help to recapture them.
I was one of twenty-one from my company who volunteered
to go. So we joined men from the Tenth and
Sixteenth Battalions, and at 11 o'clock prepared to storm
the wood where the cannons were.</p>

<p>We had only forty yards of open ground to cover,
but the German artillery and machine guns worked havoc
among us. It did not take us long to run those forty
yards.</p>

<p>We were soon in the wood, where it was so dark that
we could hardly distinguish friend from foe.</p>

<p>I ran in and out among the trees and asked every one
I met who he was. I came upon one big fellow. My
mouth opened to ask him who he was, when his fist shot
out and took me between the eyes. I went down for the
count, but I knew who he was&mdash;he was a German. I
got up as quickly as I could, you may be sure, and swung
my rifle to hit him in the head, but the stock struck a
tree and splintered. I thought I had broken all my
fingers.</p>

<p>I found three wounded men, French, I thought they
were, in that gloom. So I carried them into our trench.
As I brought in the last one, the officer said, "You are
doing good work, Houle." I asked him why he thought
so; and he answered: "You have brought in three
wounded men and when we put the light on them we
found they were Germans." Well, I am glad I saved
them. I would have done so anyhow, had I known their
nationality. For we were all trained to give a wounded
man help, whether he were friend or foe.</p>

<p>Yet it is dangerous work, helping a wounded German.
I never helped another, after the experience I had. It
was one of the two occasions when I knew with certainty
that I killed a man. He was a wounded German soldier.
We found him suffering and weak. But we knew we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
could save his life and were dressing his wound. My
back was turned. He took a revolver out of his tunic
pocket and fired point-blank at me.</p>

<p>I do not know how I escaped death. Perhaps it was
because his hand shook from weakness; perhaps my
guardian saint turned aside that death bullet. Anyhow,
he had his revolver in his hand. We had to act quickly.
My officer spoke a quick word, and I made sure that he
would never fire another shot.</p>

<p>Well, we got our machine guns. But the Germans
had blown them up, and all our sacrifice of men was in
vain.</p>

<p>We were relieved by a British regiment before morning
and marched back to our billets to have a rest. I
slept all the rest of the night until 11 o'clock the next
morning. It was the first rest I had had in forty-eight
hours, with only a slice of raw bacon and a piece of
bread to eat.</p>

<p>These were little incidents of the bloody battle at
Ypres. That afternoon some of the boys brought out
tables from a house and placed them in the sun. The
civilian populace, in their flight, had left behind their
live stock. We caught some hens and rabbits and cooked
them in wine we found in a cellar. Ah, that was a feast.
I never had a better one.</p>

<p>Yet we were strange feasters. Had some artist been
able to paint us he would have had a strong canvas. Some
of the boys had their heads bandaged, and nearly all of
us were covered with dirt and blood. Some sang for us,
though others were downhearted. It surprised me that
a few hours after we had faced death and had been
suffering untold hardships we could now gather like
college boys at a beer night feast and sing.</p>

<p>During the rest of that battle we lived in the reserve
trenches, bombarded day and night. The battle lasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
twenty-one days. When it was over they called a roll
of our regiment. There were 500 of us when we left
Montreal. As the commander called the roll, name after
name was met with no response. At Ypres 480 out of
500 of us were left dead on the field. And in reality
our loss had been greater than that, for our 500 had been
thinned out in other actions and filled with a full roster
again. Twenty of us out of 500 survived at Ypres.</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;FIGHTING AGAINST BARBARISM</p>

<p>We fought madly at St. Jean, after Ypres, and retreated.
We rested eight days at Bailleul, marched
through Steevwerck and rested eight more days there;
we also rested at Estaires for eight days, then through
Vieille Chapelle, and then had another eight days' rest.
We reached Lacouture at night and went into battle again
at Richebourg.</p>

<p>We arrived there in May, 1915. Richebourg is in
France, eight miles from the Belgian border, on the English
front. A very small agricultural village we found
it, coming to it after a hard twelve-hour hike from
Bailleul. We got into the Richebourg trenches in the
evening.</p>

<p>I found myself in a German trench, captured by the
British. Five hours before the battle had raged, and the
place was still full of wounded and dead, both German
and British. Trench by trench we worked our way into
the British front line. We had been reinforced by the
Twelfth Battalion of reserves, which was made up of
French Canadians and Englishmen; thus our decimated
regiment was swelled to 365 men.</p>

<p>The battle was going on. Relieving the front line
proved a dangerous task. We had to proceed cautiously
to avoid bullets, and it took us three hours to reach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
front line, which we did at midnight. Ten of our
men were killed by shrapnel or stray bullets on the way.</p>

<p>Then came the report from our left that the Germans
were trying to counterattack. Our officers called for
volunteers for a bomb and hand grenade throwing party.
We were gone twenty minutes, fifteen of us in all; three
of us were wounded, and Carrier of Montreal was killed.
We were able to report on our return that we had done
effective work. After that things quieted down and gave
us a breathing spell.</p>

<p>The next morning we were ordered to take the German
first-line trenches. Our cannon began to clear the way
first at 2 o'clock in the morning. The famous French 75&mdash;the
French 75 which is always helping the English at
difficult times&mdash;blasted out the pathway over which we
were to charge. We had thirty-two of these 75s&mdash;four
guns to each of the eight batteries. When worked hard,
these guns can fire twenty shots a minute.</p>

<p>We were all Catholics. At 5:30 o'clock we began to
say our prayers, and soon after we were charging with
fixed bayonets. We had no great difficulty in taking
two lines of trenches. But when we reached the third,
they rallied and drove us out. There the Germans made
a counterattack, raking our flanks with their machine
guns as soon as we reached their third trench. They
killed 75 of us, wounded over 100, and took 20 prisoners.
We were obliged to leave our wounded in their trench
with the dead.</p>

<p>I lay until night in the German second-line trench,
among the dead and wounded. There was, of course, no
communication and we could not clear the place we had
taken or get medical help for the men who writhed in
agony all around us. A company of Highlanders from
the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Battalions came to our
relief at night. The Highlanders and my company were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
given orders to capture an orchard on our left. Through
this orchard ran the German trench. German snipers
were concealed in the old apple trees, and the place
seemed one huge shrapnel, which burst and never ceased
bursting. Three-quarters of our men were killed. And
I, as usual, was among the unwounded survivors.</p>

<p>We took the orchard trench, but were glad enough to
retire at the counterattack, and unfortunately lost our
orchard and our third trench. Listen! Out of 250
Highlanders, only forty came back. Of my own company
(which you will remember had been reinforced to
365 men), only seventy came back. And Roméo Houle,
with the charmed life, was again among the few who
returned, and had not a single wound.</p>

<p>About one and one-half miles on the right of Richebourg,
we took up a new position, after three days' rest
in a village next to Lacouture. The Scots Greys and
the Coldstream Guards were in the trenches. To our
surprise, they greeted us with shouts and cheers. We
asked them why they cheered us so. They answered that
they thought so well of the Canadians that, helped by
them, they would encounter any odds. The shooting was
then going on; the Scotch had tried to advance and had
been pushed back. When our company came, we all
tried to advance together. Again our company had been
reinforced, this time to 420 men.</p>

<p>The Germans occupied a hilly place. Although they
were only sixty yards away, we fought back and forth
for an hour. Our first two charges were stopped by
their entanglements. The wires in many places were
not down at all and we could not pass. Then our artillery
began to mow among the wires. In thirty minutes
our way was clear, and on the third tussle we got into
the German trench. It was a close fight. We used even
our fists. My bayonet was broken, and I used my gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
as a club. There we remained until we got reinforcements.
Out of 420 men, my company was reduced to
eighty. No, I could not be killed.</p>


<p>IX&mdash;"I AM PROUD OF THE FRENCH
CANADIANS"</p>

<p>We were at Cuinchy only two days, but we took three
lines of trenches there, and retreated. The dead we left
on the field covered the barbed wire entanglements. The
Germans in their counterattack came at us in serried
ranks. Our coffee grinders smashed their first, their second,
their third lines, but they came on and on, resistless
as a flood. We could not but give way and withdraw
before that awful advance. They cared not for the lives
of men, but thought only of the ground they gained.
Every foot they advanced cost them many, many lives.
But those trenches from which we retreated are now
occupied by the British. All their silly outlay of men was
in vain.</p>

<p>To the south of Cuinchy, we fought at Givenchy. Five
days we were in the third line, and four in the first. German
mortars opposite us were belching forth thunderous
volumes of flame and death. Chaos was at Givenchy.
Lightning lashed us&mdash;the swift lightning of 10,000 rifles
and great batteries of field guns. Yet we destroyed their
mortars and took fifty prisoners. Do you wonder that I
am still proud that I fought there&mdash;proud of the French
Canadians? What soldiers ever fought more valiantly?
Who ever gave their lives in a noble cause more gladly?
Who ever met certain death more steadfastly and unafraid?
Whatever I think of war&mdash;and before I am
done, I shall tell&mdash;whatever I think of war, I say that
braver soldiers never lived or died than the gallant French
Canadians. But oh! I am sorry to think how their handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
lines have been thinned&mdash;thinned more than most
people know.</p>

<p>Two of our men cared for ten prisoners. A Sergeant
led them away. I suppose that they are in England now,
spectacles for the curious. They were brave men. I
am sorry for their captivity, on their account; but glad
to see their terrible martial strength thus ebbing. When
we took a trench, the Germans would throw up their
hands and cry "Comrade." The Saxon Germans always
surrender the quickest, because they are so nearly akin
to the English. The Bavarian Germans and the Prussian
Guards are different propositions.</p>

<p>At Béthune, a town of 50,000 population, we had a
ten-day rest. They shifted us to Oblingham&mdash;and then
another rest. And then three more weeks of fighting at
La Bassée. It was the same story!</p>

<p>I had fought in the first line of the battle front until
all the bed I knew was wet earth, and all the rest I
knew were snatches of sleep obtained during lulls in the
rocking tumult. From almost the very opening of the
war I had fought. And long since I had had my fill of
the fighting.</p>

<p>The American Consul at London wrote me a letter. It
came, I remember well, in October, 1915. It brought
me my first ray of hope&mdash;my first real hope of life. For
I knew that that strange chance which had spared me so
many months, when so many of my comrades had died,
would not always be mine. I knew that death fought by
my side in the day and slept with me in the night. I
saw him grinning at me from the twisted features of
those shot in the battle. I heard him gibbering on the
horrible field at night!</p>

<p>The Ambassador gave me the hope that, having been
under age and an American by birth when I enlisted, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Government might secure my discharge. Influential
friends were working for me.</p>

<p>On Jan. 10, 1916, in the forenoon, I was notified to
report to headquarters, 300 yards behind our firing line.
I laid low in the front trench all day, fearful lest at the
last moment I should be shot. For a friend, who had
obtained a long furlough for rest in England, on the very
eve of his departure, had been killed by my side a few
days before. It seemed so pitiful an ending, just when
he was going home.</p>

<p>So eager was I to leave, that I planned the best I could
how to escape. But I knew that if I yielded and went,
I should forfeit my life. By a great effort, I restrained
myself. But at 4:30 o'clock I could stand it no longer.
My friends wept at the parting&mdash;for joy for my sake
that I was going back to life; for grief that they were
left, to die probably, so far from their fair Canada.</p>

<p>At 4:30 o'clock, then, with last hand-grips and the well-wishes
of all, I jumped a little ditch and crept on hands
and knees in a circuitous way to the headquarters.</p>

<p>I walked seven miles to the railroad. The firing sank
away. The trenches and their fevers, their wounded and
dead, their noxious odors and their deadly gases, and the
man-eating rats&mdash;all became a memory. I was free,
going home to my wife and child, my parents, my friends,
unwounded.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The thrilling experiences of a British soldier who succeeded,

Rendered desperate by the brutality of his jailers, he
made up his mind to get away at all costs. Once he tunneled
his way out of the camp, only to be recaptured and punished.
A second time he tried, only to meet with the same fate and
more severe punishment. But liberty still beckoned, and yet
again, with two comrades, Southern essayed the feat&mdash;this
time successfully&mdash;and eventually reached the dear homeland.
A remarkable human document recorded in the <i>Wide World</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;"WHAT I HEARD IN CAPTIVITY"</p>

<p>I am back again in England, back in my beloved native
town, with its houses all askew and its quaint and
narrow streets. For nearly two years the Huns have
had me in their grip; they had drawn for me the picture
of an England that would have been a nightmare; they
had told me of towns bombarded from the skies and
reduced to ruins, and of thirty-three British warships
sent to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>What did I expect? Much what I have found; for
we learned to suspect those German-made victories by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
land, by sea, by air, and we discovered means of inoculating
ourselves against the poisonous virus. Scraps of
newspapers enclosed in parcels from home, tales passed
from mouth to mouth&mdash;things like this gave us courage
and hope.</p>

<p>To you, mayhap, captivity is just a word, at best or
worst suggestive only of discomfort and loss of personal
liberty. To me it represents all that is hideous, humiliating,
irksome, and galling. It brings back before
my eyes two years of petty tyranny, of pin-pricks, aggressiveness,
hostility, degradation, and, at times, absolute
cruelty.</p>

<p>Those who have never lost their freedom cannot understand
how the iron may enter one's soul; they cannot
understand the days and nights and weeks and months of
maddening monotony.</p>

<p>It was from this death-in-life that I determined to
escape almost before I had tasted the full bitterness of
my lot. It was from this that I fled, a hardened, desperate
man. My heart seemed to have turned to stone,
my soul to flint.</p>

<p>To talk like a soldier, I was simply "fed-up," and I
meant to let nothing come between me and freedom.</p>

<p>Before I tell you of my three escapades I want to try
to show you how I came to be in that miserable plight&mdash;a
prisoner-of-war. With my comrades of the Cheshire
Regiment I found myself, in August, 1914, trying to stem
a rushing, raging torrent. What a handful we seemed;
what millions the Germans appeared! It was fight and
retreat, retreat and fight, with little time for food, little
time for attention. Wounded or whole, we fought doggedly
on; and I mention this because, when I was taken
prisoner on October 21st, 1914, I was suffering from a
wound in the left leg.</p>

<p>It had not rendered me helpless, however, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
twenty-eight of us were surrounded I did my best to
escape through a village, but was brought back by the
the German soldiers and marched with the rest for a
day and a night, without food or water. A tramp of
twenty or twenty-five kilometers landed us at Douai,
where, for a week, we were lodged in a church, sleeping
on the floor and kept from starving to death by the
food the French people were permitted or ordered to
give us.</p>


<p>II&mdash;IN A "BLACK HOLE" ON WHEELS</p>

<p>I have no wish to paint the picture in lurid colors, yet
I wish some of our pro-Germans and "pacifists" could
have had a taste of that journey to Germany. Over
seventy of us were packed together in one cattle-truck,
occasionally kicked or prodded with bayonets by the
gentle exponents of <i>Kultur</i>. Food? We were shown
loaves of bread, we were asked to look at buckets of
water&mdash;but these things were not for us; they were
merely exhibited to torture us, a typical example of German
spite. For three days and three nights we were
huddled in that truck "Black Hole" on wheels. Not all
of us reached Germany alive.</p>

<p>As for myself, I was too hard to kill, too full of hate
and detestation of my captors to go under without a
struggle, and during the seven-kilometre tramp from the
station to the "Münster Laager" I registered a mental
vow that "this child" was going to make a bid for freedom
at the first opportunity. As we left the station
the civil population, who were none too delicate in their
attentions, sang "Deutschland über Alles." And they
seemed to think it was true, too.</p>

<p>This, however, was only on a par with the arrogance
we encountered in the Laager. The guard told us how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
German hosts had invaded England&mdash;or were going to
do it in two months; and of how the All-Highest War
Lord, the Kaiser, was to have his Christmas dinner at
Buckingham Palace. The ignorance of some of these
"educated" Huns was colossal, and you will perhaps
scarcely credit the fact that I have been asked by Germans
whether it was possible to get all the way to England
by train!</p>

<p>Soon after we got into camp we begged an officer to
give us water, but with a contemptuous sneer he advised
us to go to England for it. Battens of straw, laid on
bare boards, were our beds, and there was no covering.
With so many French, English, and Russians as prisoners,
I can tell you it looked rather hopeless just then
for the Allies' chances of victory. Those were the early
days, remember, when the Germans seemed to be winning
all along the line, and when every success made
them all the more brutal.</p>

<p>Right through the winter of 1914-15 food was scarce
and clothing scant, and punishment more liberal than
either. For a paltry offence I was tied to a post, six
hours at a stretch, for ten days, while for telling a
brutal German what I thought of him I was put into
a dark cell for nine days. This particular Hun had
knocked down and kicked a Norfolker, who then went
for him with his shovel. The Englishman was marched
off&mdash;to what fate I am ignorant.</p>

<p>A piece of black bread and a cup of coffee was our
customary breakfast, and for dinner we had each a pint
of soup which got steadily worse as the winter advanced.
Six pounds of bread served ten men for a day, and occasionally&mdash;it
was like an angel's visit&mdash;we had a bit
of beef or sausage. I spent the first twelve months of
my imprisonment between Redbarn, Münster, and Sennelager,
often going out in charge of working parties, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
a non-commissioned officer doesn't actually labor except
of his own free will. I cudgelled my brains until my
head ached in trying to devise plans to escape, but so
far had seen no opportunity.</p>

<p>At the Münster camp, where I again found myself
permanently lodged in September, 1915, I slept in a big
wooden shed which accommodated two hundred of us.
Right round the camp, at a height of eight yards, ran
a fence of "live" electric wire. To attempt to pass
through this meant certain death. I had no wish to
try electrocution as a means of suicide, although it would
have been speedier and less irritating to the temper than
the kicks and cuffs and manifestations of spitefulness to
which we were all liable. On the outer side of the wire
perambulated the sentries. What chance had a prisoner
to escape?</p>

<p>My straw bed was placed in a far corner of the "little
wooden hut" to which I have referred. At last a happy
thought occurred to me. I would burrow my way from
the hut to the outer world, or, in other words, beyond
the deadly wire! This, however, was easier said than
done, but after a time I commandeered a shovel and surreptitiously
removed a piece of board from one of the
rafters. Possessed of these implements, which I carefully
hid, I waited until all was quiet and the tired sons
of England, Russia, and France were fast asleep. Then,
raising two or three boards beneath my heap of straw,
I started upon a voyage of discovery.</p>


<p>III&mdash;"HOW I TUNNELED TO LIBERTY"</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, there was a hollow space beneath
the whole expanse of flooring. Quietly I began to dig
in the soft soil, pushing it beneath the floor as my hole
grew bigger. The first night I kept at my task for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
or three hours, and then, leaving my board and shovel
in the cavity, I returned to my bed, carefully replacing
the lengths of flooring which I had removed, and obliterating
all traces of my pleasant evening's occupation.</p>

<p>It seemed a forlorn hope upon which I had entered&mdash;half
a chance in ten million. Yet I was prepared to
seize it, ready to risk imprisonment and punishment on
discovery rather than not make the attempt.</p>

<p>For six weary weeks I worked at my tunnel, and so
secretly was the job carried on that only one man in the
hut shared the knowledge with myself. I often told this
man off to keep watch and ward and give me the signal
should any too-inquisitive sentry or guard take it into
his head to depart from his wonted custom and visit the
place at night. The sharer of my secret decided that
when I had burrowed clear of the sentries he would
escape with me, but at the last moment his nerve forsook
him and he "cried off."</p>

<p>As I have said before, I was thoroughly "fed up"; I
had reached that condition of mind when we believe the
ills we are enduring cannot be equalled by anything that
is to follow. Nothing save force, I decided, should deter
me from pursuing my plan to the bitter end.</p>

<p>Thus, night after night, I dug and delved, distributing
the <i>débris</i> as best I could. I took precautions with diabolical
cunning, for I was not going to throw away my
chances by any eleventh-hour recklessness. Six weeks&mdash;forty-two
nights, to be exact&mdash;I played B'rer Fox in my
"dug-out," six feet down, until my tunnel was fifteen or
twenty yards long and big enough for me to crawl
through. The sounds above and the distance that I
knew the wire fence to be from the rear of the hut told
me when my burrowing had gone far enough.</p>

<p>It was a fortnight before Christmas, 1915, that I broke
out from my burrow. I timed my exit for the change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
sentries, at seven-thirty in the evening. Of food I had
virtually none, with the exception of an odd biscuit or
so. I possessed, however, what I deemed to be more
important than food&mdash;a compass, bought from a Frenchman,
which I had guarded far more jealously than Hun
ever guarded Englishman.</p>

<p>After the preparations I have described, the actual escape
seemed as easy as falling off a log. I emerged from
the hole, saw that the coast was clear, and made off towards
the north-west. Walking throughout the night,
keeping to the fields and the woods, and continually crossing
ditches and other obstacles, I put as much distance
between me and Münster Laager as was humanly possible.
It was really very uneventful.</p>

<p>In the day-time I kept to the woods, sleeping and resting;
at night-time when compelled to cross a road I slung
my boots across my shoulder and flitted by like a shadow.
The weather was wet, my clothing was well-nigh soaked,
hunger gripped me&mdash;and then came Nemesis.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I had met very few people. Three
nights I tramped, three days I lay hid. It was during the
third night that all my plans went wrong, all my fond
visions were dissipated like a pricked bubble. And I
believe it was my over-cautiousness in walking a road
without boots that proved my undoing.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;RECAPTURED&mdash;"I WAS SENTENCED TO
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT"</p>

<p>A policeman challenged me and I replied&mdash;I hadn't
much German&mdash;"Deutsch." All, I think, would have
gone well had he not glanced at my feet. Then he
promptly switched on an electric lamp, worn at his
breast, and covered me with a revolver. The game was
up; my race was run! I had to admit that I was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
"Engländer." To add to my mortification, I learned
from the officer that I was only five or six kilometres
from the Dutch frontier.</p>

<p>Well, to give the German his due, that policeman played
the good Samaritan. He knocked up a cottager and
got me some coffee and bread&mdash;and never did anything
taste so sweet. I was utterly reckless as to my fate,
for I had developed a devil-may-care frame of mind. I
was disappointed&mdash;that was inevitable. Who wouldn't
have been disappointed at seeing a scheme that had arrived
so near fruition come toppling down like a house
of cards? Punishment I knew I should get, and punishment
I certainly received.</p>

<p>I was sentenced to ten days' solitary confinement in
a cell, at first totally dark, to which the light was gradually
admitted. Next I was paraded round the camp as
a standing example of Germany's might, and a hideous
warning to "evil-doers." A red and white band sewn
to my sleeve gave notice to all and sundry that this was
the ill-mannered churl who spurned <i>Kultur</i> and wanted
to get back to that despicable England about which the
Germans sang.</p>

<p>I should here explain that, in the intervals of contriving
splenetic irritants for their prisoners, my captors
often sang the notorious "Song of Hate." I have seen
them march in all solemnity around the camp singing the
"Vaterland" and "Gott Strafe England"&mdash;and the spectacle
was too much even for my limited sense of humor.</p>

<p>Their brutalities were beyond the belief of any commonplace
civilized beings. At the Sennelager camp, for
instance, there were many civilian prisoners, and they
were treated far worse than we soldiers were&mdash;and that's
saying something. One especial form of amusement (for
the Huns) was the shaving of civilians. Whether it was
as punishment or as sheer deviltry I don't know, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
have seen many civilians shaved on one side of the head
and face, with half their hair, half their whiskers, and
half their moustaches gone. Fit game for a Nero,
wasn't it?</p>

<p>Neither that ten days' confinement, nor yet the beautiful
red and white band, and my exhibition before my
compatriots, broke my spirit, and I was still determined
to see England or die. The Germans talked of their
glorious deeds. Goodness knows how many times they
sent our navy to the bottom of the sea, and I have forgotten
how often they told me their Zepps were "sending
England to H&mdash;&mdash;." They were very full of their Zepps,
by the way, but we didn't swallow all their stories either
of their ships in the air, their ships on the sea, or their
victorious armies on land.</p>

<p>Now and again, you see, authentic news reached us,
and an occasional smuggled newspaper told us that the
tide had turned and gave us heart of grace to bear our
burdens, if not with patience, yet with some degree of
fortitude.</p>


<p>V&mdash;"MY SECOND ATTEMPT&mdash;AND PENALTY"</p>

<p>My second attempt to escape was even a greater fiasco
than the first; I had scarcely a run for my money. A
cart daily conveyed swill from the camp to a large piggery,
this work being delegated to a French prisoner.
A man named Grantham and myself resolved that,
whether we went to the dogs or not, we would at least
go to the pigs. With the cognizance of the French
driver, we hid ourselves between the swill barrels, which
were usually left in the cart on its arrival at the piggery
overnight. We were not missed from the camp, and
remaining in our unsavory quarters until dusk fell over
the land; we then slunk away like Arabs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>I have omitted to tell you that once again I had a
compass. The other one had been taken from me on
my recapture, but I had purchased a second from a Russian
for the sum of seven shillings. We were without
food, and a dark night seemed to favor us, but before
morning&mdash;we had covered only six or seven kilometres&mdash;a
couple of sentries simply ran into us, and we were haled
back to camp. It was ignominious, but inevitable.</p>

<p>If one escape merited ten days' solitary confinement,
a second justified twenty-one. At any rate, that was my
portion, and Grantham got ten days. Once again I was
trotted round the camp as an object lesson on ingratitude
for favors already received. It was after this that the
monotony of prison camp life was relieved by a gentle
jaunt to Russia. I am not surprised that people should
imagine that I am romancing when I speak of going from
Germany to Russia. Yet I am stating nothing but the
bare truth. Eighty-nine men from the Münster camp
were told that they were to join a party destined for
"unknown regions," and as one of the officers put it to
me, he considered I had "better go, or I should go somewhere
worse."</p>

<p>How that would have been possible none but a German
mind can conceive. At a railway station two thousand
of us, sad-looking fellows most of them, were assembled
from different camps. We were in the train for seven
days, plus two days at Frankfort, before we reached our
destination. At Frankfort martial law was read, and
we were politely informed that we were to be asked three
times whether we would work, and if we refused we were
to be bayoneted! It was to Windau, in Russian Poland,
that we were eventually taken, and the life there was a
hell upon earth.</p>

<p>The re-laying of railway metals torn up by the retreating
Russians and a certain amount of farm work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
were the duties imposed upon us. The sights I have
seen! I hate the very thought of them! Men were continually
being felled to the ground and kicked and bayoneted.
I have even heard captives, worn out and dispirited,
beg the sentries to shoot them and thus end
their misery, and the poor wretches meant it, for it would
be better to die than to endure such slavery. One poor
chap, goaded into retaliation, was kicked viciously, had
a bayonet thrust through his leg, and was then flung,
half dead and bleeding, into the guard-room.</p>

<p>After this there was a wholesale refusal to work and
much bludgeoning, and general mutiny threatened. The
Germans saw they had gone too far, and they capitulated.
They told us that if we behaved fair to them they would
be fair to us. All the time we were under martial law,
and the orders that were read out to us were signed by
Hindenburg.</p>

<p>Escape now seemed farther off then ever, so I played
'possum, pretended to have rheumatism and other ailments,
and was sent back to Münster. I was still wearing
the red and white signal of my attempts to escape,
and one of the first things that I did on my return was to
commandeer a fresh coat, otherwise I should have been
a marked man.</p>

<p>What new plan of campaign could I evolve? Two
had been tried and failed; yet I was just as keen and just
as ready as ever to stake even life itself on a desperate
throw. It was now that I met with a bit of luck, for
I happened to fall in with Private Leonard Walker, of
Oldham, and Private Fussell, of Taunton, one a Welsh
Fusilier and the other a Somerset. They were bent on
escape even as I was, and Walker had also tried the
game before, having spent five days and five nights in
the open with a chum, living on biscuits and a rabbit
which they picked up and steering a course by map<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and compass. They, like me, had been caught, when
crossing a railway line. A woman signalled to the sentry;
they were captured, and had undergone solitary
confinement. Walker, Fussell, and myself were a pretty
good trio, with none of the turning-back spirit in our
composition. Lot's wife turned back, you'll remember,
but her fate was a shorter shrift than ours, and far less
uncomfortable. A grand chap for the job was Walker,
and his experience stood us in good stead. He studied
the situation, weighed matters carefully, was resourceful
and cute, but nevertheless had that touch of recklessness
so necessary for such a venture.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;"MY THIRD ATTEMPT&mdash;THE FLIGHT"</p>

<p>We fixed up our arrangements and bided our time.
We stuffed our pockets&mdash;"stuffed" is a good word&mdash;with
twenty-one biscuits saved from our parcels&mdash;twenty-one
for three of us. We also had two tins of sardines,
and, better than all, a map and compass. One thing
that we determined to do was to get rid of a conspicuous
stripe sewn down the sleeves of our coats and the legs
of our trousers. It was a bit of a puzzle at first, but
Walker got over the difficulty by cutting up his waistcoat
and inserting strips under the light stripes, which,
when we got clear, were torn away, leaving us to all intents
and purposes clothed like ordinary citizens and
not like wicked "Engländers."</p>

<p>It was on September 27th&mdash;fateful, happy day!&mdash;that
our opportunity came. We were at work in a barn on
a farm four or five miles from the Laager, for which
work I had volunteered with a view to escape, feeding
a threshing machine. It was a job that was supposed to
last four days, but while the guard was out of the way
we quietly put the machine out of action with a crowbar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Then we went off to dinner and ate as hearty a meal
as we could in case of emergencies. Two sentries stood
guard over about twenty of us, and one of them showed
signs of sleepiness.</p>

<p>"Why, Colonel," said I to the other, "aren't you going
to have a nap with your friend?" He grinned and
walked away to lie down at the far end of the barn.
Thereupon we three conspirators passed the tip to each
other, and off we went. There were some thick bushes
growing outside the barn, and we had placed our coats
containing the food near the door. I was wearing a
cap, a cardigan jacket, a black scarf, and an old coat. I
won't deny that my heart beat pretty briskly as we made
for the bushes as quickly and as noiselessly as we could.</p>

<p>There was good cover of this sort for a mile or so,
and it was pretty certain we weren't missed, at any rate
until we had got quite a respectable start. We had some
open country to negotiate before we found the friendly
shelter of a wood, and lay there until night closed in.</p>

<p>As a ruse we first turned eastwards and then cautiously
worked our way round until we had our heads in the
direction of liberty. During the night we heard sounds
which led us to believe we were being searched for. We
had resumed our flight from the wood about seven
o'clock, and we kept going until day broke. Another
wood sheltered us during the day, and for the time being
we dared not leave it, for our furtive observations showed
us a considerable tract of open country which it would
have been madness to face in broad daylight. We were
taking no undue risks this time, and we husbanded
our resources and our strength, even as we husbanded
our food supply, taking it turn and turn about to watch
and sleep.</p>

<p>Water in the ditches supplied us with drink, and the
rain saw to it that we had plenty of water both without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and within! When darkness returned we set off once
again, often starting at our own shadows and slinking
back into the blackness whenever we heard a sound.
There was safety as well as weakness in numbers&mdash;safety
in our lookout, and weakness in the inability of
three men to give a reasonable explanation if we were
tackled. Whenever we had to take to the road we carried
our boots and trod as warily as panthers. Three or
four times we had to pass through towns and villages,
but our luck was in, and we were not challenged. Our
heads were turned aside and as much distance imposed
as possible whenever we heard anyone walking on the
thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Bootless and footsore, we also traversed four miles of
railway, and it seems miraculous, looking back as I
now do, that we were never seen or stopped by sentries.
Three times, too, we had, willy-nilly, to cross rivers.
We "did" our first river in boats which we found secured
to the bank of the stream. There were two boats, and
in the darkness we paddled them as silently as Red Indians
to the other side, and then turned them adrift. I
suppose it was what you might have called a theft, but
stern necessity knows no law, and a German boat more or
less was neither here nor there.</p>

<p>Another river was spanned by a bridge, and you can
imagine how we slipped across, as noiselessly as ghosts.
Neither bridge nor boat offered itself as a solution of
stream number three, but it did not prove a particularly
formidable obstacle, and we walked through it, the water
rising to our waists.</p>

<p>From dusk to the time the first streak of light began
to gild the eastern sky we "padded the hoof." On the
fourth night we reckoned that we must be nearing the
frontier. Tired and weary, footsore and very hungry,
our vigilance was never relaxed. That last night we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
approached a town of considerable size. We did not
dare to walk through it, and made a long detour in order
to pass wide of the outskirts. Though we knew it not,
we were nearing the last lap of our journey.</p>

<p>It was dark, with a velvety blackness, and neither
moon nor stars were showing. Suddenly the stillness of
the night was broken by the challenge of a sentry. Evidently
he had seen three silhouttes, or imagined he had.</p>

<p>Were we to have had all our toil in vain? Were we
to be shut out even as the gates of Paradise seemed to
be opening to us?</p>

<p>Without a sound we dropped prone upon the ground
and waited, waited, listening to the beating of our hearts.</p>

<p>For twenty minutes or more we lay there, each thinking
his own thoughts, and listening to the silence. At
last, with a whispered word, we rose and moved on,
our boots in our hands, to the north-west. Soon we saw
the white stones which told us that the frontier was in
sight, and I rolled down a steep bank and walked right
into a man. It was a soldier. Hazy in mind, scarcely
realizing that I had crossed the Rubicon, I stood speechless.
Then the sentry spoke.</p>

<p><i>It was a Dutchman!</i></p>


<p>VII&mdash;"SAVED&mdash;WE REACHED DUTCH SOIL"</p>

<p>I called out joyfully, and my comrades, the men who
had proved themselves true and staunch, having
joined me. The soldier made himself understood, and
tumbled to the fact that we had escaped from the land
of captivity.</p>

<p>"France, Russia, or Engländer?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Engländer!" I replied, with pride. Out came his
hand, and I clasped it. He greeted all three of us warmly,
muttering his congratulations the while. To a house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
close by he took us, fed us, and warmed us. It was like
a foretaste of heaven, and we could hardly believe that
our troubles were at an end.</p>

<p>We had struck the frontier, it appeared, in the State
of Overyssel, thirty to forty kilometres from the Münster
camp, and we could not have made a luckier strike. It
was not long before we were put in touch with the British
Consul and were sent to the Sailors' Home at Rotterdam.
Everybody was kindness itself, and I shall
never forget the good old Dutch pastor who prayed with
us that we might reach home in safety.</p>

<p>To each of us he gave a Testament, in which he wrote
our names and his own, together with the words, "Take
God's gift, the gift of Eternal Life, by believing in the
Lord Jesus." Passports were soon obtained; we were
photographed just as we were, and at last we landed at
Hull, thankful with a big thankfulness.</p>

<p>Need I describe my home-coming? I had had no
chance to prepare my people, and I dropped down upon
them like a visitor from Mars. It was a brief visit to
begin with, for my first duty was to report myself at
headquarters, and by the next train I was on my way
to Chester, where I was immediately granted a month's
leave. What is to be done with me it is for others to
say, but I am hoping I shall get some of my own back
upon the Huns.</p>

<p>With scarcely an exception, you can say that the British
in captivity are in good heart and are not cowed or browbeaten.
I am told that I am one of the very few Britishers
who have escaped, and I am not surprised at that,
for we are more strictly guarded than the French or
Russians, who are often permitted to work on farms from
Monday to Saturday without any guard whatever.</p>

<p>My impressions of Germany are of no value, for I saw
little of the civil population. But it was evident from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the yarns spun us by the soldiers that they are fed on
lies and that a day of awakening will come. To my
mind, they are certainly suffering from the effects of the
blockade. When we first arrived in Germany food
seemed plentiful, but latterly the soldiers often asked us
for biscuits and other things sent us in the parcels which
kept us alive.</p>

<p>Working parties on the farms were fed decently in
1914 and 1915, but during these last months the farmers
would give them a few potatoes and a scrap of bacon,
and excuse themselves on the ground that it was all they
had, and there was no food in the country. For what it
is worth, it is my opinion that Germany is kept going
largely by the work of prisoners of war. They labor
on farms, they are sent into coal mines, chemical works,
and munition factories, they make and repair railways.
They work hard&mdash;from six in the morning till six at night&mdash;and
their wages are threepence a day. Whether the
Germans still believe they are winning I cannot say, but
their treatment of prisoners has lately improved, and
this seems significant. Winning, the German is a bully
and a cad; beaten, he whines, and his temperament is reflected
in his conduct towards those who are in his
power.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CLIMBING THE SNOW-CAPPED
ALPIAN PEAKS WITH
THE ITALIANS</h2></div>

<p>"<i>Battling Where Men Never Battled Before</i>"</p>

<p><i>Told by Whitney Warren, an American on the
Austrian Front</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>After climbing Carso peaks with Cadorna's Alpini, descending
into shell craters with Petain's poilus and fraternizing with
Haig's Tommies on the shell swept fronts of the Somme, Mr.
Warren, an American, has made the world comprehend the
loyalty, the sacrifices and the practical services of the Italians.
Fired by his enthusiasm for the courage, devotion and military
ability of the Italians, he tells the vivid story of the comparatively
little known fighting on the Italian-Austrian front in the
<i>New York Sun</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;OVER THE ALPS WITH CADORNA'S MEN</p>

<p>Sly hints are about in America as to the pusillanimity
of the Italians. Some persons are ready enough to absorb
these hints. Nothing could be more monstrously
false. It is not a matter about which I need to argue&mdash;I
<i>know</i>. No one with the full use of eyes and ears and
possessed of moderate intelligence could spend twenty-five
days with Cadorna's fighting men without being
thrilled. They are battling where men never battled before&mdash;upon
the tops of high mountains, elevations that
only eagles knew before Germany put the torch to civilization.
They are swinging bridges across incredible
chasms. They are chiselling roadways where monkeys
could scarcely cling. They are blowing off the tops of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
gigantic mountains in order to progress a few meters.
They are accepting the most frightful hardships with
that charming acceptance of the inevitable which, it seems
to me, is so characteristically Italian. They freeze. They
starve. But always they go ahead&mdash;and Vienna knows
with a drag at the heart that the standards of Italy will
shortly snap from the housetops of Trieste.</p>

<p>I say that men never fought before in country so frightfully
convulsed by nature. Wily Austria, peering into
the future, knew that the hour would come when Italian
forbearance would strike twelve and demand the liberation
of oppressed Italians in the Trentino, and so Austria
in the Peace of Villafranca brought about an iniquitous
boundary which left her with her feet planted in
Italian territory, with her fortresses upon Italian mountain
crests. And that desperate handicap was what Italy
faced when she went to war to liberate her people. All
the odds were against her. But she is winning&mdash;winning
a few hundred meters at a time. She conquers first one
peak, then a whole range, then another peak, then another
range, and all the time fights classical warfare,
the classical warfare that has been abandoned in France
and Belgium. Hear this story&mdash;one of fifty such:</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF ITALIAN-AMERICAN WHO
BLEW UP A MOUNTAIN</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago a charming, cultivated young Italian,
son of the Duke of Sermonetta, came to the United
States to study mining engineering. He sank his identity
in a family name, Gealsio Caetani, earned his degree
in the Columbia School of Mines, went West and labored
at $2 a day with pick and shovel so as to know his business
from the ground down, became superintendent (out
of sheer ability) of a great mine in Alaska and eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
opened a consulting office in San Francisco. When
the Germans overran Belgium Caetani threw up his business,
hastened to Belgium and volunteered. When Italy
was ready to fight he joined his own colors and entered
the aviation service. I saw him in flying man's toggery.</p>

<p>"But you, Caetani, are an engineer," I said. "Why
not overthrow mountains and build bridges instead of
winging about as an observer." Then I went away to
see how successful the Austrians had been in destroying
the art treasures of Venice and Milan; and after a
while men told me the story of an engineer who uprooted
a mountain range upon which two battalions of Austrians
had defied an army for many months. This engineer
who had solved nature's great problems in the
Rocky Mountains and in Alaska climbed like a fly up the
face of sheer rock cliffs, managed to drag after him the
necessary drills and then, with Austrian riflemen patrolling
high overhead drilled a tunnel of 300 meters length
into the solid rock. It took three months. He stuffed the
tunnel with seven tons of explosives, attached his fuses
and his wiring, scrambled back down the cliffs and invited
the army to a spectacle. A touch of the forefinger, a
cataclysm, cheers ringing through the defiles. The mountain
top was gone. This engineer was the American
trained Gealsio Caetani. The mountain was the Col di
Lana in the Trentino.</p>

<p>When one visits such men one climbs to the aeries of
eagles, for it is at such heights that the troops of Italy
are fighting. To such heights&mdash;2,000 meters, 3,000 metres,
often 4,000 meters, they must swing or drag the
great guns, their stores of provisions, their supplies of
ammunition. Major Neri, a great engineer, nonchalantly
bridged two mountain ranges with slender wire cables;
They had told him it couldn't be done. He did it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
asked him how. "By fastening one end of the bridge
to one mountain and the other end to another mountain&mdash;so,"
said Neri. What does one reply to such men?</p>

<p>In the Carso I formed a pretty good idea of the difficulties
of the Italian campaign. From the point of view
of attack the character of the country is the cruelest
imaginable. It is simply inconceivable that any human
beings could persist for two years blasting out trenches
inch by inch, building up both sides to a proper height
with fragments of rock and myriads of sand bags under
the most terrific and plunging crossfire of mitrailleuse,
musketry, hand grenades and all kinds of artillery, until
at last a trench was constructed varying from ten to
twenty meters in distance from the paralleling enemy's
work. Everywhere were barbed wire and chevaux de
frise, endless lines of them. The rocks between the
trenches were literally and absolutely covered with shells
of every caliber, exploded and unexploded, and with
thousands of hand grenades, so that it was a very serious
matter where one should put one's feet. Many
of the dead were lying under stones, and fragments of
bodies were strewn about.</p>

<p>In the beginning there may have been some stunted
trees upon these hills, but when I was there all verdure
was gone, burnt up in shell fire or gas attacks. An
officer who accompanied me described these attacks as
the most inhuman imaginable. I had known this man
for years and no better sportsman or soldier exists. His
mother was an Austrian and he entered the war without
any great enthusiasm. But he told me that never in his
life had he experienced the sensation of hate until he
witnessed the first gas attack. The sight of his men returning
under its influence filled him with passion, and
the finding of the iron spiked maces which were used
by the Austrians to hammer the heads of the bewildered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
gasping Italians left no room in his heart to doubt
the baseness of the enemy. One of these maces was
given to me. I have it.</p>


<p>III&mdash;GIGANTIC FEATS OF ITALIAN
ENGINEERS</p>

<p>The engineering problems solved in the Carso are
such as would be considered insurmountable in peace
times. Fighting has been taken to the very tops of the
mountains. In order to get material where it is needed
and to transfer troops quickly from one sector to another
more than 6,000 kilometers of automobile road have been
literally chiselled out of the solid rock of almost sheer
cliffs. To the most difficult peaks mule paths have been
carved, and after victory comes a whole new and marvelous
country will be opened to the dilletante tourist by
means of these extraordinary trails. The Italian engineers
have hesitated at nothing. Mountains considered
unscalable have been mastered, and one now goes up
to a forbidding peak or crag as one formerly went up
to an easy pass. Palisade formation is no longer an obstacle,
the roads traversing the palisades being of perfect
type and execution. The admiration and marvel I experienced
going over them are indescribable and the feats
that have been accomplished well nigh unbelievable.
Over the roads and mule paths stretching higher and
ever higher to the snow-piled mountain tops cannon of
all calibers are hauled by traction or man power and are
installed in impregnable positions. Often heavy cannon
are passed from mountain top to mountain top by means
of wire cables, just as cash boxes are flung by wire trolleys
from department store counters to cashiers' desks.</p>

<p>Having motored nearly to the summit of a mountain, I
entered a tunnel. Presently I found myself on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
side of the mountain, in a gallery where a battery of
heavy artillery was mounted. On the one side as we entered
we had looked down upon the sunlit plain of Vicenza.
On the other side, in the shadow, we faced the
tops of the Trentino Alps. The contrast was bewildering.
Praise is poor recompense for the men of science
who dared to imagine and for the willing hands that
dared to execute those extraordinary feats. And the
one I mention was not exceptional. An Alpini remarked
to me: "It is indeed the death of Alpinism, for every
one now is an Alpinist!"</p>

<p>Where it is impossible to use roads or mule trails for
the transport of troops or supplies the Italians use aerial
railways, called telleferica. I saw one of these consisting
of a single span of 2,160 meters&mdash;this was Neri's
remarkable accomplishment. And ever so often cannon
in leash, men in baskets go swinging from post to post
over chasms that make the heart pound as one darts a
look into their recesses. There is to-day in all that mountain
country scarcely a spot upon which a bird may roost
or to which a goat may climb that the Italian engineers
have not conquered, and in conquering achieved so much
in pressing back the detested Austrians. And with what
cheerfulness, light-heartedness, courtesy, consideration
for one another, devotion and loyalty are the Italians
accomplishing these miracles of warfare. When one has
looked upon their work and has associated with them in
the deep snows and in their tunnelled quarters one is
seized with an irresistible desire to tell the world how
wonderful they are&mdash;to describe, however poorly, their
triumphs of will and courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>


<p>IV&mdash;"AVIVA ITALIA!" UNCONQUERABLE
LATINS</p>

<p>It is not in the army alone one finds that spirit. In
the little villages along the roads the very bright-eyed
children cry, "<i>Aviva Italia!</i>" and there is the soul of it.
There is expressed a profound love of country. Italy
no more doubts that she will reconquer Trieste and Trent
than France doubts the recovery of Alsace and Lorraine.
The despoiled Latin is determined to have justice, to
wring justice, from the Teuton maurauder, and peace talk
is a weariness to them in their exalted mood. The spiritual
and economic interests of Italy and France have been
held apart only by Teutonic perfidy, intrigue and insinuation,
but all misunderstandings are disappearing and absolute
confidence is taking the place of doubt. A captain
of Alpini said to me: "France and Italy are one&mdash;is it
not so, sir?" How many times have we heard discussed
the reasons why Italy was so long in declaring war
against Germany! For my part I have never doubted that
Italy's reasons were perfectly legitimate. One does not
quit one system of alliance for another without damaging
a whole series of interests. Italy, so to speak, found
herself in the position of an individual who must divorce
in order to remarry. But what must be remembered is
the absolute loyalty of the Italians. Never have they
changed since the beginning of hostilities. They are a
people of heroes.</p>

<p>Let me speak of Milan and Venice as I saw them in
intervals of visits to the mountaintop fighting fronts.
At Milan my first care was to study the precautions
taken against the destruction of art treasures. Always
the Latin, who creates, is forced to protect and defend
his works from the German, who destroys. The cathedral,
all in stone, risks little from fire, all the glass and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
precious objects having been taken to places of safety,
and it remains intact and marvellous under its mantle of
lace, intact in spite of the Austrians and marvellous in
spite of Ruskin. At Santa Marie del Grace the "Last
Supper" of Leonardo is protected by a wall of sandbags
and by a fireproof curtain. Churches and museums have
been emptied of their riches. In the streets I watched
the crowds&mdash;a people astonishing in purity of line and
proportion, moving always with grace and harmony.
Here lies for me the secret of their artistic superiority,
for it is well known that the artist, in spite of himself, reproduces
in his work his physical perfections and faults.</p>

<p>In Venice the same precautions are taken as at Milan.
The Scaliger tombs are covered with sand and the more
important ones are enclosed in stone turrets. All statues
are shrouded in a preparation of straw and plaster sufficient
to protect them from fragments of bombs, but what
a wonderful mark for some aerial bandit San Zeno and
St. Anastasia, with their wooden ceilings, would be.
In the middle of the night I disembarked in Venice, where
two carabinieri conducted me to a hotel hermetically
sealed so that no ray of light escaped. And here I stayed
in the pitch dark with a prospect of being lodged under
the Piombi of the Ducal Palace if I betrayed the slightest
evidence of having a light.</p>

<p>As always Venice presents an incomparable aspect.
There is no better moment to visit Italy than during a
war, for it is only then that one finds the Italians really
at home. A war clears the scene of a whole world of
intruders. A great calm reigns over Venice. All classes
fraternize. Life is very normal, and no one regrets the
absence of the Germans, Austrians and Hungarians, who
used to arrive from Trieste&mdash;no more hobnailed shoes,
no more Tyroleans, no more alpenstocks, no more noisy
vulgarity. The harbor is empty except for a few captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Austrian vessels. Off in the distance to the south-west
is the great fleet, ready at a moment's notice to take
position in the open sea. The city presents no particularly
wartime characteristics excepting at night. I know
of no pen or brush that has been able to render justice
to Venice&mdash;Turner perhaps; but Guardi and Canaletto
were too much the slaves of detail and of other conscience.
At 8:45 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> all lights were put out. It is absolute
darkness with the exception that a little blue light,
very feeble, burns at the end of each street, just enough
to give guidance for direction. Even the little lamp
of the fisherman which hangs before the Virgin on St.
Marc's has been extinguished. Happily one is permitted
to smoke, otherwise it would be difficult to navigate about
the narrow streets. One cannot imagine the intensity
that a lighted match takes, and the cafés, which are better
patronized than ever, resemble enormous nests of glow
worms, everybody puffing at a cigarette or a Virginia.
An amusing detail is that one must pay in advance for
one's refreshments, because in case of an aerial attack
the general cry is "<i>Sauve qui peut?</i>" and heaven help
the proprietor.</p>


<p>V&mdash;DROPPING BOMBS ON VENICE</p>

<p>The aeroplane&mdash;that is the great question; not that
they are feared. It is that every one asks with feverish
anxiety what possible further ravages will be accomplished
among the marvellous art treasures. At the time
of Titian, when fashion decreed that every woman must
have that wonderful blonde hair for which Venice was
famous, many of the houses had constructed upon their
roofs an open loggia, which was called "Paltana." It was
there that the beautiful Venetians after having bathed
their hair in some mysterious fluid remained for hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
allowing it to dry. Well, it is from these "Paltana" that
the guard watches over the city, armed with mitrailleuse
and furnished with megaphones, and every half hour one
hears the sentinels calling as they repeat the cry ringing
from the Campanile of St. Marc: "<i>Per l'aria, buona
guardia</i>." And throughout the entire night the silence
is broken by a chain of cries which reunites these invisible
belfries. Nothing lacks. Searchlights, special cannon,
aerial squadrons and aquatic squadrons&mdash;all are ready
for defence. But Venice is so filled with treasures that
it is only by the greatest luck that a bomb does not destroy
some unique object. It is my firm conviction that
some day St. Marc's or the Ducal Palace will be smashed
by the Teutons. Although everything possible in the
way of protection has been done, one trembles at the
thought of what may happen. Already the Church of
the Scalzi has been pierced, and of the wonderful fresco
of Tiepolo not a piece as big as one's hand remains.
Bombs have fallen within a few feet of St. Marc's.
These are the attacks of savages, purely barbarous, with
the sole intent of destroying something.</p>

<p>From the third story of the Hotel Danielli I witnessed
raids by Austrian hydravians. At 11:30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the signal
of danger came. A gun roared from the Moline. Sirens
shrieked in many parts of Venice. Then there was
temporary silence, disturbed only by the rustle and shuffle
of feet as people scurried to shelter. Presently all the
batteries surrounding Venice opened fire. In intervals
of this din one heard the whine of the Austrian air motors,
a noise like the buzzing of a gigantic fly. It advanced
over rooftops. Many batteries spat fire into the
air. But the only sign of the air machines that I observed
was what might be called a faint, very vague sort
of electric fluid which seemed to appear momentarily in
different parts of the heavens. From time to time all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
firing ceased. Silence came. One again heard the hum
of the invading motors. Then the air was assailed by the
explosion of a dropped bomb, followed by the crash of
breaking roofs, the splintering of glass, the shrieks of
injured persons. The whole effect was stupefying to me,
not terrifying; but there is, too, a feeling of quite utter
helplessness. Shortly after the last bomb was dropped
the signal came that it was all over. The people fairly
flung themselves into the streets searching for souvenirs,
scratching about amusingly with candles and matches as
they recounted laughable or tragic experiences. Such
raids are made preferably during the moon. It is known
that the defence is imperfect, that the only perfect defence
is one of reprisals, but as an English General said
to me, "That is a dirty game, dirty ball, as you Americans
say. It is pretty hard to descend to their methods."</p>

<p>Sem, the caricaturist, has a picturesque method of noting
the odious uselessness of bombarding Venice. "To
fire on Venice," he says, "is as if one amused oneself by
firing at the chandelier."</p>

<p>I spent twenty-five days among these Italians, upon
the plain and among the mountains, days of wonderment.
One must see the difficulties in the midst of which
they are fighting, the thousand obstacles, to do them justice
even feebly. The King is the soul of the army and
of the Government. He directs the struggle upon the
field of battle&mdash;and he is "always on the job." He is always
in the place of danger and honor and yet no one
hears him spoken about. He disdains the theatrical attitude.
Beside the King is the Duke of Aosta, a fine
presence and a fine character, and Gen. Cadorna, an energetic
chief. Cadorna is a great friend of France. In
an hour's talk with him he supplied me with a vivid
sense of the unfaltering spirit of Italy. I saw much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
D'Annunzio and I cannot resist the temptation to add
my humble praise to all that has already been addressed
to him. He made every effort in lifting Italy to arms
against the Teutonic Powers and he well personifies in
his ardor and simplicity the people who followed his exhortations.
He spoke with good humor of the sufferings
he endured, saying that in their attempt to save his sight
the doctors forgot that he was possessed of a body and a
soul. I read a letter of his, written when he was 14, in
which he predicted that his mission on earth would be
to chastise the hereditary enemy of his country. It is a
beautiful letter. I thought of that first chapter of Macchiavelli
in which he writes:</p>

<p>"The people who habit the countries on the north, situated
on the other side of the Rhine and the Danube, are
born in these prolific regions in such multitudes that a
portion are forced to abandon the native soil and to look
about for a new country where they may advance themselves."
The Germans of to-day proceed differently, but
in the same spirit&mdash;but they are finding their match and
more than their match in the indomitable Italy of to-day.</p>

UNITED STATES ARMY
TRANSPORT</h2></div>

<p><i>Story of a Voyage in the China Sea</i></p>

<p><i>Told by (name suppressed), a United States Army
Officer</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the private letter of a captain of the &mdash;&mdash; Infantry,
United States Army. It was written at sea on the transport
<i>Thomas</i>, somewhere between Keelung and Nagasaki in the
China Sea. The army officer, whose name is withheld by request,
tells how the transport, with the whole &mdash;&mdash; Infantry,
officers with their families, and civilians, numbering 2,000, passed
through a typhoon in a night of terror, paying high tribute to
the discipline of the soldiers. It is one of those human documents
that give a deep insight into the adventurous experiences
of the American Army in the days of World War.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;"HOW WE LEFT MANILA BAY"</p>

<p>
U. S. Army Transport, <i>Thomas</i>,<br />
At Sea, August 21, 1917.<br />
</p>

<p>I will tell you a tale of the China Sea, only it will
differ from the usual sea tale in that it is absolutely true.
The scene is laid to the east of Formosa and in the vicinity
of the chain of the Ryukyu Islands, which extend
in a general southwesterly direction from the southern
end of Japan toward the northern end of Formosa.</p>

<p>At noon, August 15, 1917, the U. S. Army Transport
<i>Thomas</i> slipped her moorings at Manila, amid usual
scenes of farewells, bon-voyages, tears, handkerchiefs,
flowers, the girls-left-behind-us, and with the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
band playing "Alohaoe." It is a scene enacted the 15th
of every month when the transport leaves for the homeland
via Nagasaki. On board were the whole &mdash;th U. S.
Infantry, with officers and their families, and civilians
and crew,&mdash;a total of some 2,000 souls. As we passed
the island fortress of Corregidor, military aeroplanes
circled over the ship. The wish of all was for more
power to the stokers&mdash;we could not get to San Francisco
too soon. As we steamed along the west coast of Luzon,
the weather was bright and the sea calm, but we knew
that in another day rough weather could be expected.
In the Balingtang Channel, between Luzon and Formosa,
the sea is practically always rough; and those waters and
to the east of Formosa are in the usual course of the
typhoons. True to form, late in the afternoon of the
16th the sea became rough. I promptly took to my bunk,
not being any kind of sailor. As I lay in my bunk next
the port with the wind scoop out, I could feel the wind
gradually rising and the alternate violent puffs and lulls
were signs that a typhoon was brewing, as the master of
the ship was well aware from his falling barometer.
Later in the evening when I left my cabin for a few
moments, my surmises were confirmed.</p>

<p>On the next day (Friday, August 17), we were well
into the typhoon. The wind was violent and the sea both
magnificent and awful. In a typhoon the wind blows the
surface water into clouds of foam and spray. For all the
world it looks like a snowstorm at sea. The waves were
frightful. As the ship dipped down between them, the
conviction was borne in upon us that if one were to land
upon the ship's deck the lookout in the crow's nest would
no longer sing out at the half hour: "All's well."</p>

<p>That night the storm seemed at its height; and it was
an anxious, trying night, with the wind howling and the
rain coming down in sheets. Very few went to sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
The water could not be kept out. It came in through the
ports and through the seams in the cabin roofs. On the
top deck, stateroom doors were forced and the rooms
flooded. Beds were wet and some cabin floors awash.
The boat hove to and kept its nose to the wind. I later
heard that we made eight miles in fifteen hours under
steam, but we knew not how far we had been blown
from our course. After about eight nerve-racking hours,
the wind began to abate; and by Saturday, the 18th&mdash;although
the wind and sea both remained high, with the
weather thick and rainy&mdash;we firmly believed that we were
running out of the typhoon. After drifting in heavy
squalls and thick weather all day, I dozed away that night
in a wet bed.</p>

<p>Later I was awakened by the rising wind, howling
through the ship's passageways and superstructures. We
were running into the typhoon again. No more sleep that
night. Experienced mariners know that the way to get
out of a typhoon is to keep the wind on the starboard
bow and side, gradually working out or getting blown
out. This our ship's master did not dare to do, for the
chance would have been extremely good that the ship
would be cast upon one of the many islands. He therefore
elected to keep the wind on the port side and run
through the typhoon.</p>

<p>The wind and sea soon became more violent than the
night before. It was awe-inspiring. For a couple of
hours it blew hard, and then at about 1:30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> there
came a sudden lull&mdash;with no air stirring, with a calm sea,
and with the barometer falling precipitately. The pressure
on the ear drums was intense.</p>


<p>II&mdash;"WE WERE FIGHTING A TYPHOON"</p>

<p>It was plain that we were in the very center of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
typhoon, and that our most severe battle with the elements
was just ahead. Some time around 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the wind
again arose suddenly, and the fight was on. It soon became
terrific and well over 100 miles an hour&mdash;estimated
by the First Officer as between 125 and 130 miles&mdash;the
worst thus far we had experienced.</p>

<p>Now ensued a time of desperate peril that even a
landlubber could appreciate. Many a prayer went up that
night from lips that had not uttered one since the days
of "Now I lay me down to sleep" at a mother's knee.
Many a rough nature felt stirring within him thoughts
and feelings that had been strangers many a year.</p>

<p>The awful force and roar of the wind, the violent
pitching and rolling, the absolute darkness outside, the
puny efforts of the big, powerful ship and its apparent
helplessness, added to the fact that we knew we were in
an unknown position in a sea in many places uncharted
and dotted with coral reefs and islands,&mdash;all convinced
us that we were in the immediate presence of the Great
Adventure and that only the guidance of the Divine Hand
could succor us.</p>

<p>The immediate scenes were enough to inspire terror.
The big steam whistle could be but faintly heard above
the wind, when it was blown to call deck hands to clear
away wreckage caused by the fall of the top of the front
mast with the wireless antennae. In the galley, right outside
my door, pots and pans and dishes and glassware
were thrown about in continuous din and confusion. In
staterooms, trunks, water bowls, and other loose articles
were flying around. It was dangerous to be about. The
thick glass of a port hole was broken to bits by a wave,
and a woman so cut by the glass as to require many
stitches for her wounds. In the troop decks many bunks
were broken and fell to the floor. Several soldiers suffered
broken legs, arms, or collar bones. The ship's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
doctor in his palmiest day in civil life I venture, never
saw things coming his way half so thick and fast. The
only way to remain in a bunk was by bracing and hanging
to rail and hooks. The first streak of dawn showed
about 5:30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, Sunday the 19th, and, though welcome,
revealed an awful sea and driving sheets of rain. This
violence kept up most of the day, until late in the afternoon
it appeared that wind and sea were somewhat abating.
The barometer was slowly but steadily rising, and it
was plain that we were running out of the typhoon. But
night was upon us, and the Master had not had an observation
of the sun for more than three days&mdash;since
Thursday noon, August 16. The situation was perilous.
A temporary respite only had been given.</p>

<p>The behavior of passengers, crew, and all during this
time was remarkable. There was not a trace of panic or
alarm. Some passengers, gathered in the main saloon,
seated about tables, talked it over conversationally. Others
remained in the social hall, in the passageways, or in
staterooms awaiting quietly the expected call. Some officers
were fully dressed in uniform, either khaki or
white, others in swimming clothes of pajamas with bathrobe
or raincoat over. The women also were in various
degrees of preparation. There was no hysteria, weeping,
or raising of voices.</p>

<p>And so the long Sunday night wore on with the three
of us in our bunks, the little boy asleep and &mdash;&mdash; and
I attempting to doze. We were destined for our third
successive sleepless night. The wind and sea were still
high. Some time before midnight I was brought to my
feet in the middle of the cabin with a bounce, by a severe
metallic blow against the ship's side. I turned on
the light and the little boy awoke startled to get into
bed with his mother on the couch and doze off again
immediately. To this date I have not satisfactorily settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
what caused that blow. It may have been the violent
impact of one of four lost lifeboats against the hull
or one of the parts of a broken davit hitting the side.
Weak and dizzy and vomiting continuously I thought it
best to remain up.</p>

<p>From some reason or other&mdash;misery or what not&mdash;the
next event of which I write was unknown to me until
after the happening. I therefore relate what I have heard
from others, whose remembrances tally very well. I was
conscious only that the ship was listing at a severe angle,
with our trunks sliding across the room.</p>

<p>At about 11 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, it seems, the ship hit something
twice, and in turn was struck on the starboard side by
two big waves. The vessel remained rigid for several
minutes (estimates vary from 5 to 25 minutes), not rolling
in wave action, but taking the seas over the forecastle.
During this time a soldier was swept overboard
and his cries for help were heard by passengers as he was
swept past. A life preserver was thrown towards him
in the darkness,&mdash;all that could be done for the poor fellow.
About this time the lookout up ahead saw a steep,
black shape close at hand, but thought it was a low-hanging
cloud. The First Officer saw it from the bridge and
immediately sent an emergency signal to the engine room.
We were merely drifting, so the engines were immediately
reversed. The ship drew away carefully. After
some time, I should say about half an hour, we appeared
again to have reached the wind and rough water.</p>

<p>I have neglected to state that some time previously I
had myself noticed (my stomach being a delicate instrument)
a sudden lull in the chop of the water and a longer,
smoother roll and a drop in the wind to almost nothing.
As the barometer was rising we could not have been in
the heart of the typhoon, and I remarked to an officer that
we must be in the lee of some land. All this occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
between 10:30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> and midnight. It is the universal belief
that the black shape just ahead was in reality a high
cliff. The further inference is&mdash;although not acknowledged
by ship's officers&mdash;that while drifting under little
or no headway the ship struck a sandbar as she dropped
deep into the trough of the big waves, close to the cliff,
and while there took two big waves on the starboard side.
Then, when the engines were reversed, she pulled off and
made away.</p>


<p>III&mdash;"IT WAS OUR LAST HOUR"</p>

<p>During all this time, though I had not noticed the two
jars (being one of the very few who did not), I was
conscious in my bunk that something serious had happened.
As a ship's officer went by the cabin, I heard
him say: "I'm going to see if the wireless won't work."
I have learned since that the Master wanted to send the
"S. O. S." out over the sea, and say that he would try
to keep his ship afloat until daybreak. Inasmuch as he
could not give our position this was but a last chance. I
was not so sick that I could not comprehend that much
in a flash. But the wireless was entirely out of commission.
When the top of the mast went on Saturday night,
the antennae had gone overboard with it. The latter had
been roughly secured again to the mainmast, but the wind
had driven the rain through the cabin and short-circuited
the sending apparatus. About this time a man came into
the passageway and began stripping the slats from a life
preserver rack. He said there was danger of the wireless
house on the top deck being swept away, and that
he was going to take the men some life preservers.</p>

<p>There was much passing to and fro. Putting on raincoat
over pajamas, I went out to look things over. In
the saloon I found some fifteen or twenty persons grouped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
about the table, in all manner of attire. All were seated,
talking in conversational tones. None had life preservers,
though the word had been passed along to put them
on and many in other parts of the ship had done so.</p>

<p>On the floor was stretched an officer with a bloody
bandage on his left eye. When the two big waves struck
he had been in the social hall. The sudden list of the
ship had catapulted him across the hall toward the open
door. He would have gone over the rail, but managed to
fetch up against a seat and land unconscious. This is
only one of numerous similar incidents. Going down the
hall on my side of the ship&mdash;starboard&mdash;I met perhaps
eight or ten officers and no women. Things were flying
loose and it was dangerous to be up. There was no sign
of panic. Conversation was general and light. Presently
a small group struck up Harry Lauder's "I Love a Lassie,
a Bonnie Hieland Lassie."</p>

<p>I had learned the real situation by this time, and was
convinced that it was our last hour. Since then I have
found that that belief was universal among all except a
few who were ignorant of conditions. So I went back to
my cabin to await events or orders, which promised to
be immediate. I sat on the end of &mdash;&mdash;'s couch, wet
with perspiration through weakness, sickness, and fear,
too, I guess. She asked me if there was any danger,
and I answered, "Yes, some danger, of course." She
made no reply and seemed satisfied. Then I reached
slyly under the bed for my revolver and cartridge belt.
I had in mind the usual sea tale of stampede under such
conditions and wanted to be ready. There was never an
indication of necessity for it, however, I am bound to
say. I did not reach for my life preserver, for fear of
raising in her a feeling of panic. The little boy still
slept. And so we waited. Nothing happened, and shortly
afterward, as before related, by the sound of the wind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the feel of the sea I knew we had pulled away from the
land into the open sea and would have at least a temporary
respite.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;"WE TOSSED ABOUT THE OCEAN"</p>

<p>Now as to the conduct of the soldiers. It was splendid
and magnificent, showing under extreme test the value of
discipline and training. They had been held under
hatches for two days, it being too dangerous on deck, so
that they were in ignorance of exact conditions. They did
know our plight was desperate. In the face of all this
when the ship struck (as my First Sergeant afterwards
told me), the non-commissioned officers assumed command
of their men, and perfect order reigned. The word
came to put on life belts. The men did so and lined up
awaiting orders. The chaplains went from hatch to hatch
and prayed with the men, who joined in earnestly. Many
soldiers offered to save passengers. An officer went below
and told the men the circumstances,&mdash;that we had
drawn off the bar and that although temporarily safe
were still in danger. The men cheered with a vim. It
revived my faith in human nature to see that in this supreme
test, no matter what their individual shortcomings
may have been before, every man had the spark of
manhood which measured up to the stern requirement.
There was no doubt in their minds but that their last
hour had come. It was too much to expect that life
boats, even if they could have been lowered, could have
existed in the sea. It was a solemn moment that will
impress itself on the future of every thinking man board
this ship.</p>

<p>During the rest of the night we tossed about the ocean,
by some chance avoiding the shoals and reefs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Ryukyu group in the vicinity of Iriomote Island (as later
determined). There was a reaction and many people who
had been awake more or less for three days dropped off
into the sleep of exhaustion. After a while the passageways
became cleared and no one was to be seen. As for
myself lying in the top bunk holding my midriff with my
hands, I tried to keep awake by once in a while raising
feet to the cabin ceiling. In time even this failed and
slumber came.</p>

<p>Dawn showed about 5:30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> that Monday morning,
bringing a foggy air but without rain for the first time
since Thursday night. The sun was necessary for us to
locate our position, and danger was imminent until this
could be known. With what anxiety that morning (my
first on deck) did the officers gather forward and watch
the captain on the bridge, with his sextant ready to take
a "shot" at the sun should it show itself. Several times
it seemed about to break through, and finally at 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> it
came out and an observation was made. After the latitude
and longitude had been determined from this observation
the captain found that his ship was near the
island of Iriomote, or some 150 miles north-east of where
he had guessed the vessel might be. In the meantime
when the fog had lifted a little, a low-lying coral reef
was seen off the port bow, not a mile away. Our course
was changed to avoid this, and about noon we passed an
island of some size on the port side showing dimly
through the mist. The land could not be identified.</p>

<p>To-day, Tuesday, August 21st, the sun rose on a comparatively
calm sea with some breeze. At about 7:30
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span> about eight miles away on the port bow was seen a
four-masted schooner, with all masts and spars in place
and full sail set. We wondered if it had been caught in
the storm and decided not, otherwise her rigging could
not have been in such good shape. Evidently the master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
thought so too, as we continued on our course. As soon
as sighting us the ship had flown the signal "B. N.,"
meaning "send assistance immediately." This was not
seen by us at the distance, so the Stars and Stripes were
lowered from top to half mast. This attracted our ship's
attention and our course was changed. As we approached
the schooner, we could see the crew working the pumps
for dear life. It was the <i>Irmgard</i> of San Francisco,
which had been laden with a cargo of copra and lumber.
All the cargo had been lost. Upon reaching hailing
distance and with the <i>Irmgard's</i> captain on the after
deck in blue shirt and khaki trousers making a megaphone
with his hands, the following conversation ensued:</p>

<p>Master of the <i>Thomas</i>: "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>Master of the <i>Irmgard</i>: "Ship half full of water. Crew
can't hold out much longer. Been through a typhoon.
Give us a tow and send aboard a machinist." A lifeboat
was lowered, and our First Officer was sent aboard
with the Second Engineer and a crew. Our First Officer
reported to our Captain: "Six feet of water. Stand
by. If she opens up she will go." A line was made
fast, and at reduced speed&mdash;with our own ship severely
damaged&mdash;we are now steaming to Keelung, the northern
port of Formosa, to leave the <i>Irmgard</i> there and to
go into drydock ourselves. The <i>Irmgard</i> could not have
lasted over night, as her captain declared. And so ended
happily another drama of the sea.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A BOY HERO OF THE MIDI&mdash;THE
LAD FROM MONACO</h2></div>

<p><i>Translated from the Diary of Eugène Escloupié by
Frederik Lees</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A remarkable human document&mdash;the diary of a fourteen-year-old
French boy, who when his father was called up, ran away
from home and managed to smuggle himself to the front, where
he took part in some hot fighting. Translated for the <i>Wide
World Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD BOY</p>

<p>Historians of the Great War will have difficulty in
finding a more striking example of juvenile patriotism
and ardor than that of Eugène Escloupié, the fourteen-year-old
author of the following pages. Born and educated
in the Principality of Monaco, he disappeared from
his home on the Boulevard de l'Ouest in the early days
of the mobilization of the French army and, hidden
among the soldiers, found his way in a military train to
Belfort. His plan was to fight side by side with his
father, a soldier in the 125th Regiment of Territorial
Infantry. Though he did not succeed, he did indeed
attain one of his many ambitions&mdash;that of reaching the
Front and witnessing the conflict. He was present at
one of the most terrible episodes of the first period of the
war&mdash;the Mulhouse affair, which cost the lives of more
than twenty-five thousand Frenchmen. There, upon the
field of battle, he assisted his adult comrades amidst the
dead and wounded.</p>

<p>The literary skill with which this human document is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
penned is often as extraordinary as the patriotic spirit
which shines out from almost every line of the narrative.</p>

<p>Eventually Eugène Escloupié returned home. But not
for long did he find it possible to resist the call of battle
which still sounded in his heart. After completing his
diary&mdash;at my earnest request&mdash;he once more turned his
footsteps towards military life in the north, where the
authorities, despite the tender years and child-like physique
of this heroic boy of the Midi, have granted his wish
"to do his duty on behalf of <i>la patrie</i>."</p>


<p>II&mdash;"HOW I WENT TO WAR"</p>

<p>When the general mobilization of the French army
began I was in the employment of a contractor. Without
a moment's delay I hurried to the Monaco railway station,
and was able to witness the departure of several
trainloads of soldiers. These ceremonies, the touching
farewells, and the joyous songs of the conscripts, made a
deep impression upon me, so that on returning home I
passed a very restless night.</p>

<p>On awakening on Sunday morning several ideas occurred
to me, but the one which filled my mind the most
was that of following a convoy of soldiers as far as Belfort,
the town where, it seemed to me, hostilities were
likely to begin. Once more I proceeded to the railway
station, spending the whole morning there. In the afternoon
I went for a walk, in the course of which I saw
several horses requisitioned by men of the 27th Battalion
of Alpine Chasseurs.</p>

<p>Returning home, I found my brother-in-law ready to
leave. His departure made my desire all the stronger,
and on retiring to bed I determined to carry out my plan
the very next day.</p>

<p>The morrow arrived. After breakfast I left the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
on the pretence of going to my work, and went to the
railway station. But entrance there was forbidden.
Every time an opportunity offered, I slipped through on
to the platform, but two minutes before the arrival of
each train it was cleared of people and, willy-nilly, I
had to leave. Eleven o'clock struck. Half-past eleven
and noon came without my being able to bolt into a
train. Returning home for the midday meal, it was
hardly over before I was again back at the station, filled
with the hope of having better luck this time. Thrice
they turned me off the platform and thrice I returned
until, at last, about half-past four, a train drew up and
I found myself in front of it. In less time than it takes
me to record the fact I dashed towards the first open door
and entered an unoccupied compartment. Ten minutes
later the train set off&mdash;and there I was, <i>en route</i> for the
Front!</p>

<p>The train was quiet, and few conscripts occupied it
until we reached the suburbs of Toulon; but from that
place fresh bodies of troops began to join at every station,
whether big or little. Ah! what a sound of singing
all along the way! At every station there was a
distribution of food and drink&mdash;bread, apples, pears, and
wine; everybody gave what he or she could. At a place
near Marseilles, during a wait of an hour and a half, a
delegation of twenty young girls of sixteen to eighteen
visited every carriage. Not a soldier went without a
gift; not one continued on his way unkissed.</p>

<p>We reached Lyons the next day at seven in the evening.
Many reservists got out here, but more joined the
train than left it. There was a wait of an hour and a
half; then off we went again. My companions in my
compartment included an Alpine chasseur, a chauffeur,
and a dog-catcher of the city of Lyons. They fell into
conversation&mdash;the dog-catcher being the first to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"That <i>sale tête de Boche</i> William has committed an
infamous action! Here am I forced to go to the war&mdash;I
who have four children, and the eldest only seven.
But since we must defend our native country, let us do so
cheerfully."</p>

<p>"You are right," replied the Alpine chasseur. "Only
a fortnight ago I got back from Morocco, where I caught
a fever and was two months convalescent. And yet I'm
going to set off like the others."</p>

<p>Conversations on those lines enabled us to while away
the time until we reached Dijon at half-past ten. Jumping
out of the train, I saw a notice-board bearing the
words, "Belfort direction, 12.12 a. m. Platform No. 3."
I proceeded to the <i>trottoir</i> mentioned, and waited for the
hour of the train's departure. At half-past eleven the
<i>employés</i> got together a long string of cattle trucks. I
was at a loss what to do, whether to get into one of them
or ask the men if that was really the train for Belfort.
In the midst of my speculation, and as though they had
understood my dilemma, the railway officials put up five
or six notices similar to the one I had seen on arriving.</p>

<p>So I entered the nearest truck I could find. It was
supplied with four seats, made of planks. I stretched
myself upon one of them and was quickly asleep.</p>


<p>III&mdash;"I FOLLOWED THE FRENCH ARMY"</p>

<p>When I awoke the sun had already risen. Looking
through an opening in one of the sides of the truck, my
gaze encountered an immense plain, neither the beginning
nor the end of which I could distinguish. I asked a man
who was next to me where we were, and he told me not
far from Besançon. Half an hour later we entered that
place. It was there that I saw a convoy of automobiles&mdash;about
a hundred&mdash;pass by. The train set off once more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and an hour's travelling brought us within sight of the
first forts of Belfort. An hour and a half later we
reached our destination.</p>

<p>Unperceived I was able to slip through the exit on
to the square in front of the railway station. An ambulance
was drawn up there. Drawing near, I raised the
covering and saw a number of soldiers stretched at full
length. In answer to my question as to what was the
matter, they replied that they were ill and had just left
the hospital; they were being "evacuated" to other towns.
Thereupon I wandered forth to make a tour of the town
and discover the object of my search.</p>

<p>The first corps I encountered was the 8th Regiment
of Territorial Infantry. I followed it and found it was
quartered on the ground floor of an hotel in the Rue
Thiers. At the end of the day, which I spent with the
men, a sergeant said to me:</p>

<p>"Eh! young man, you don't belong here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"Monaco."</p>

<p>"Why did you leave Monaco for Belfort?"</p>

<p>"To go on campaign."</p>

<p>"But where are your parents&mdash;your father?"</p>

<p>"Father is mobilized."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"And your mother?"</p>

<p>"She's at Monaco, with my sisters."</p>

<p>"And why did you leave them?"</p>

<p>"As I've already told you, to go on campaign."</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Eugène Escloupié."</p>

<p>"Age?"</p>

<p>"Fourteen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you had your dinner?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, come with me. I dare say there's a drop of
soup left, and if there is any meat you shall have it."</p>

<p>I followed the good-hearted sergeant to the kitchen
where, for the first time, I ate out of a French soldier's
<i>gamelle</i>. When I had finished the non. com. said to me:</p>

<p>"You shall remain with us. Go sit outside a bit and
then get off to bed. But it's on straw, not on feathers
you'll sleep, my boy. However, since you want to go
to battle, you must accustom yourself to our life, and if
we leave, you shall come with us."</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, mon sergent.</i>"</p>

<p>"Good! I'm pleased to see that you're beginning to
accustom yourself to the military life."</p>

<p>And with those words he left me.</p>

<p>Acquaintance with the soldiers was quickly made, but
there was one in particular with whom I became friendly.
When the sergeant had gone he took me aside and said:</p>

<p>"Have you eaten?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the sergeant saw to that."</p>

<p>"Well, if you're still hungry, don't hesitate to say so.
I've got some bread and meat I was unable to finish.
Come now, will you have some?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks, I'm no longer hungry."</p>

<p>"Then you must be thirsty, and you won't refuse a
drop of wine. One moment, whilst I fetch my canteen."</p>

<p>He was back in two minutes with his canteen and
poured me out a good quartern. Then we sat on the
edge of the pavement and began to talk about one thing
and another.</p>

<p>As a fine rain began to fall about half-past eight, everybody
went inside to go to bed. Unlacing my boots, I
stretched myself out in the straw by the side of my new
comrade. At the door of our quarters stood a sentinel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and although we slept with the door open and without
blankets we were not in the least cold, for there were
thirty-six in our room, which measured but twelve metres
by nine. A terrible storm raged outside. About one
o'clock in the morning a deafening noise awakened us.
Everybody asked what had happened. One said it was
thunder, another the cannon. The sentry declared he
had seen the flash and the smoke; he was certain it was
the cannon. But no one was sure. It was not until
daylight came that we learnt through an officer that it was
indeed the guns. Thus, for the first time, I heard the
roar of cannon.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;"MY FIRST DAY IN THE ARMY"</p>

<p>On waking up at about half-past six the storm had
abated a little; it was still raining, but in an ordinary
manner. The distribution of "juice" (coffee) began. A
milkman happened to be passing down the street and my
chamber-fellow called to him and made me drink two
quarterns of milk, for which he paid the modest sum
of one penny.</p>

<p>We spent the morning in visiting the town. I saw the
Place Quand Même, the Lion of Belfort, and the aviation
ground, where new airships were being built. It
was rare to find a street in which there were not one or
two houses bearing marble plaques on which were such
inscriptions as this: "Here was born General &mdash;&mdash;. Appointed
general on such and such a date. Fought in the
following campaigns&mdash;&mdash;. Died in such and such a year."</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went to a fort, where my comrades
received their equipment&mdash;a rifle and bayonet, a knapsack,
a cartridge-pouch, a canteen, a blanket, a pair of
leggings, and a covering for the <i>képi</i>. On returning to
the cantonment a captain delivered the following speech:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"My lads, I wish to inform you that one of these days
we are going into action. It may be to-morrow or the
day afterwards&mdash;I cannot say exactly. But I would ask
this of you: to behave like brave men and follow your
leader, for all the time you follow and obey me I will
undertake to lead you along the path of honor and victory.
Remember the words of your chief. You must
not say, 'I shall not be frightened,' for I myself shall
be one of the first, on the first bullet whistling past my
ear, to duck my head and be scared. But I shall salute
it and overcome my fear and never fail you. Therefore
recollect that and say to yourself, continually, 'Yes, I am
frightened, but I shall overcome my fear;' and in that
way you will succeed."</p>

<p>This little discourse was heartily applauded by the
conscripts, and it was not until the captain had shaken
all of them by the hand that he left.</p>

<p>We breathed the fresh air for half an hour longer before
retiring to rest. The night passed without incident.
I did not awaken until dawn. The weather was fine.
After taking our coffee we were about to go out when the
order came that no one was to leave. At half-past nine
we learnt that we were to go into action&mdash;a happy piece
of news which filled all the reservists with joy. Preparations
were made. I had been provided with a rifle,
a pouch, a canteen, and a <i>képi</i>. At the thought of seeing
the Boches fighting and being overcome I was filled
with joy. But not for long, for at half-past two, before
setting out, the company was passed in review. It was
then that an officer caught sight of me and cried out:</p>

<p>"What's that boy doing there?"</p>

<p>"He is following us, captain," replied my friend.</p>

<p>"Where does he come from?"</p>

<p>"Monaco. He left because his father was mobilized
and he was without a parent."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's your name?" demanded the officer.</p>

<p>"Eugène Escloupié," I replied.</p>

<p>"Have you any papers to prove your identity?"</p>

<p>"<i>Non, mon capitaine.</i>"</p>

<p>"Are you French?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, mon capitaine.</i>"</p>

<p>"It's a pity, but as you cannot prove your identity I
cannot keep you. A strict order has just been given
against allowing any foreign person with the soldiers."</p>

<p>"But I'm not a foreigner, <i>mon capitaine</i>."</p>

<p>"I dare say not, but you must prove to me who you
are."</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said. I had to abandon
my equipment and flee. Before leaving, however, my
comrade said to me: "Don't be discouraged. Go to the
Bureau de la Place&mdash;military headquarters&mdash;and tell
them that, being an orphan, you left Monaco to follow
a regiment, and see what they say. <i>Bonne chance.</i>"</p>

<p>Having embraced him, I set off and went straight to
headquarters. Entering the first office I came to, I saw
four or five officers, including a doctor, in conversation.
Hardly had I crossed the threshold than one of them exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What do you want here, boy?"</p>

<p>"Let me tell you, please, that I was at Monaco&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And now you're at Belfort!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;at the beginning of the war. My father had
left to join his corps, and being alone I left in a train
to come here and go on campaign with the soldiers."</p>

<p>"You've come here, then, to enlist?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot do that; I'm not old enough."</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>bon!</i> Why are you here then?"</p>

<p>"To see if you can pass me into some regiment or
ambulance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>All the officers had listened attentively during this examination.
The doctor then spoke.</p>

<p>"Since you wish to enter an ambulance, it's to work
there?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"In that case I'll take you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"Go downstairs and wait for me at the door, and when
I come you shall go with me to the ambulance."</p>

<p>I descended the staircase more joyfully than I had
mounted it, and waited at the appointed spot. It was not
long before the doctor followed and took me off with
him to the military hospital.</p>


<p>V&mdash;"WE FIGHT ON SOIL OF ALSACE"</p>

<p>I had already been two days at the ambulance when,
at half-past five on the morning of the third day, the
réveillé sounded and we were informed that we were
to leave for Alsace. Preparations were made immediately,
and at seven o'clock we set off. The cavalry marched
away first; then the infantry, whilst we others formed
the rearguard. The Red Cross section including myself,
were in the lead, followed by the ambulances and motor-buses
containing the ladies of the Red Cross and the
doctors.</p>

<p>We set foot on the annexed soil of Alsace at nine
o'clock. What a sight it was to see the frontier posts
overthrown and the Alsatians cheering our troops! Our
soldiers had already passed that way, for tricolor flags
were to be seen everywhere. The sight touched our men
and filled their hearts with courage.</p>

<p>We camped in a village, and it was not until five o'clock
in the evening that we set off again. After marching
for twelve kilometres, we began to hear the cannon, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
which we concluded that our comrades could not be far
distant. I have forgotten to say that we were not in
the first line, but on our way to join our comrades, who
were in need of reinforcements. At nine o'clock we
camped, sleeping in a cornfield. No sooner had I
stretched myself out on a favorable spot than I fell
asleep, not to awaken until dawn, when several detonations
aroused me. I found that we were only eight
kilometres away from the Germans. So, at last, we
were to see the Boches&mdash;to fire upon them and to bring
them down!</p>

<p>When we reached the second village the enemy were
not far away. They had already bombarded several
farms, but our "75's" had opened fire and succeeded in
silencing the German guns. All this was splendid, but
sad. Moreover, we had not yet seen one of the enemy.
Still marching forward, we came up with our comrades.
The ambulance was installed in the neighboring village,
three kilometres distant from where the battle was being
waged. Campbeds having been set up at the Mairie and
in the school, the Red Cross men proceeded to the
scene of the fight, and some of them ventured forth, under
the shower of bullets and shells, to bring in the
wounded.</p>

<p>We still kept a sharp lookout for the Boches, but they
were well concealed and invisible. Suddenly, everybody
cried, "There they are!" and we beheld a green, grass-colored
mass, about seven hundred yards to our left,
issue forth from cover. They were received on all
sides with volleys from our infantry. The duel lasted
for about half an hour; then the enemy broke into flight
and our soldiers went in pursuit.</p>

<p>From that time we began to pick up the wounded. It
was terrible work. There were dead men, lying face
downwards, some of them half-buried by shells. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
poor fellows lay with shattered arms and legs shot off.</p>

<p>It took two hours to bring in our wounded. We carried
them to the motor-buses and the ambulances, which
transported them to the village, where they received first
aid. After that we advanced to the spot where we had
first seen the Germans, for in their retreat they had abandoned
their wounded. There the sight was no less
sickening. The number of wounded was about the
same as on our side, but the dead greatly outnumbered
ours. By the time we had carried in all the wounded it
was about five o'clock and we had had nothing to eat
since the morning, for circumstances had not permitted
us to return to the village. Four in our section of
Red Cross men were missing; two had been killed by
stray bullets and two others were slightly wounded.
We did not reach the village until six o'clock. The soup
was got ready, and we ate with a good appetite. The
revictualling department was very well managed; we
ate fresh meat. Having taken our fill, we stretched ourselves
out in the buildings requisitioned by our troops,
and a quarter of an hour later were fast asleep.</p>

<p>We were awakened at four o'clock in the morning to
join the regiment and collect the soldiers who had been
wounded since the previous evening. Leaving the ambulance
in the village, we set off at half-past five and at
about six reached the scene of the fight of the day before.
We then followed in the footsteps of our troops, in the
direction taken by the retreating Germans. It was easy
to distinguish the road, for it was littered with dead and
wounded. Here and there, too, were dead horses, with
their legs sticking straight up in the air. The first
wounded we met with were about fifteen hundred yards
from the scene of the battle. Doubtless the Germans
had stopped and a second fight had taken place, but,
judging by the small number of dead and wounded, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
could not have lasted long. However, those few must
have suffered terribly. The poor fellows had been lying
there for fifteen to sixteen hours without assistance,
and several of them were unconscious through loss of
blood.</p>

<p>Our soldiers had advanced six kilometres, and we came
up with them about eight o'clock. They were camped
in a wheat-field, not far from a fairly important village
to which the Germans had retreated and which they were
busy fortifying. Our cavalry discovered this on a reconnaissance,
during which our brave <i>piou-pious</i> fortified
themselves&mdash;first of all their stomachs, and then the
ground.</p>

<p>On seeing this camp in the open country, I likened
it to a cinema scene representing American cow-boys.
At one spot was a group of men, sitting on the ground,
resting, joking, and smoking. Near them were their
piled arms, with knapsacks all around. Here and there
were officers walking up and down. The horses were
in a corner, cropping the beautiful green grass of Alsace.</p>

<p>In the midst of this peaceful scene there was heard a
humming noise, followed by a few rifle-shots. An aeroplane
appeared, evidently sent by the enemy to discover
our positions. After having dropped seven or eight
bombs, which missed their mark, it wheeled round and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Whilst the soldiers were encamped their chiefs had
telephoned to the ambulance to join us as soon as all the
wounded had been sent to the rear.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;THE STORY OF A LIEUTENANT</p>

<p>It was thus that, little by little, in the midst of fighting,
we passed beyond Altkirch and reached the neighborhood
of Mulhouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Our front was very extended. After the capture of
Altkirch, the order was received to march on Mulhouse,
distant about twenty-five kilometres. We had covered
about half that distance when we came across thirty
wounded, including a lieutenant, who told us the following
story:</p>

<p>"We numbered about two hundred and were advancing
without the support of artillery when, suddenly, we
found ourselves face to face with four German guns.
They were so well hidden that we got within about six
hundred yards before we saw them. I ordered my men
to take cover, and hardly had they thrown themselves
to the ground than the four guns were fired. None of
us were hit. Making a bound forward, I got my men to
take cover again, whereupon the four cannon spoke once
more. This time eight of my men were hit, including a
sub-lieutenant, two sergeants, and a corporal. Thus we
progressed until we were within eighty yards of the guns.
Just as I was about to order a bayonet charge, sure of
capturing the battery, four detonations rang out afresh
and I was thrown to the ground. I must have fainted,
though not for long&mdash;a quarter of an hour, perhaps&mdash;for
when I came to I saw my men retiring. They were
quite right in doing that, all the officers, with the exception
of a few corporals, having fallen.... Whilst I was
examining my wound, I heard the sound of marching
behind me. It was the German infantry, and as it swept
by a soldier stopped and bent over me. I feigned to be
dead. He began by tearing my sword and revolver from
me, then he undid my puttees, and finally took off my
boots. I was boiling over with anger, uncertain as to
what to do, whether to keep up the pretence or show that
I was merely wounded. When he had robbed me of
half my possessions, he decamped to rejoin his regiment.
Heaving a sigh of relief, I closed my eyes and tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
sleep, but in vain. Three hours later I heard a sharp
fusillade. I sat up and beheld the Germans in retreat.
My soldiers had found reinforcements and beaten the
Boches back. Several bullets fell near me. I thought
that my last hour had come when the Germans once more
passed over me. But what a pleasure it was to see them
fleeing before our men!... Night began to come on;
I closed my eyes, and this time I slept."</p>

<p>The officer had been wounded by a shrapnel bullet,
which had entered his shoulder and descended almost to
his elbow. He had fallen about two in the afternoon.
It was nine o'clock in the morning when we found him,
so he had remained without help on the field of battle
for fully nineteen hours.</p>

<p>Wounded men were picked up all along the way. We
reached the walls of Mulhouse without encountering any
serious resistance. Cavalry was sent on in advance to
reconnoitre the town, and returned with the information
that Mulhouse was defenceless. We accordingly entered
the town, headed by the regimental band and cheered by
the crowd. Our troops encamped on the Place de la
Mairie and other squares. Just as they were about to
requisition quarters for the night a sharp fusillade came
from several windows. It was thought, at first, that a
number of inhabitants had revolted, but the trouble
spread and shots poured from all the windows surrounding
the squares where our men were stationed. It was
then discovered that the Germans were there in hiding,
with machine-guns and rifles. It was a veritable death-trap,
and our men were compelled to beat a hasty retreat,
but not before more than twenty-five thousand of
them had fallen. The stretcher-men succeeded in collecting
a few of the wounded, but they had to abandon
large numbers, for the enemy was at hand and had already
captured several ambulances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>This defeat did not succeed in demoralizing our brave
soldiers, who reformed a few kilometres from Mulhouse.
Though they had to retreat, they occasioned heavy losses
to the Germans.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;"FATHER&mdash;I WISH TO FIGHT BY YOUR
SIDE"</p>

<p>We retired to Altkirch. Here reinforcements arrived,
and it was whilst marching to counterattack Mulhouse,
after a small fight in a village we had already passed,
that I was wounded. "Wounded" is perhaps hardly the
word, but this is how I received my injury. After a
heavy bombardment by the enemy of the place we occupied,
we had to evacuate it somewhat rapidly. Whilst
getting out of the way of a shell I climbed over a wall
about six feet high and rolled to the ground. I picked
myself up immediately, thinking nothing was the matter,
but a sharp pain in my left arm soon convinced me that
I had sprained it severely. It was, indeed, so badly hurt
that I could not get over the wall again and had to call
a Red Cross man to my assistance. Subsequently I was
sent with the wounded to the ambulance, where the doctor
who had taken me under his protection at Belfort
massaged my injured limb with camphorated oil and
dressed it. He decided that it was better I should no
longer remain with the ambulance, so he sent me in a
Red Cross train to Lyons, where I was in Auxiliary Ambulance
No. 37. My duties there, as an assistant, were
to carry food to the wounded, read the newspapers to
them, write their letters, and do any other necessary light
work. I remained there a month, and when my arm was
no longer painful they sent me to Tournon to complete
my convalescence. It was whilst there that I wrote
the following letter to my father:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>
"Tournon, November 10th, 1914.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>&mdash;At the present time I am at Tournon,
in the Ardêche, and I have just received a visit from
mother, who has left for Narbonne, where she hopes to
see you. You will doubtless have learnt from her that
I went to Belfort and served with an ambulance, but
that, owing to there being too many Red Cross <i>employés</i>,
I was sent with others to Tournon, where I am in convalescence,
after spraining my arm, which is now well
again.</p>

<p>"As you know, my desire is to enlist and follow the
army to the battlefield. Mother tells me that one of these
days you will be leaving for the front. A ray of hope
flashes to my brain. My dream may at last be realized.
That depends on the kindness of one man, your captain,
and his kindness will consist in accepting me for his regiment,
to fight side by side with you. If he is willing,
he can only accept with your consent, but I do not doubt
for a moment that you are ready to give your signature.
I implore you, therefore, to speak to your captain, for
if he is a true patriot he will understand the reason why
your son of fourteen begs him to accept me in his company
to go on campaign with you, even though it be
only to raise up the poor wounded who have fallen gloriously
for France, and who, as I have already seen, remain
eighteen to twenty hours on the field of battle, exhausted
through loss of blood. But my desire does not
end there. I wish to fight by your side, and even to
avenge the name of Escloupié if, unfortunately, you are
seriously wounded. I promise you that if that happens
in a bayonet charge and I am by your side, the Boche
who is the author of your wound will pass to the other
world&mdash;and quickly, too. If your captain is a good
patriot and possesses a good heart, I repeat he will not
refuse to relieve a poor little French heart which laments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to find itself useless, when, at fourteen years of age, one
can render service, especially when the honor of the
country is at stake.</p>

<p>"I shall not say much more, for my heart beats too
quickly. That ray of hope revives me. I beg you to
make this request for me. Speak to your captain&mdash;to
your commandant, if the captain will not suffice&mdash;or to
the general if that is necessary. And if my wish is granted,
I swear on my honor that I will fight, not as a boy
of fourteen, but as a soldier of the 125th Territorial
Regiment.</p>

<p>"Farewell! My hand trembles. I cannot say more;
if I could, it would not be a letter I should write, but a
book.</p>

<p>"Farewell! Farewell!</p>

<p>"Whilst awaiting your reply, receive from your son&mdash;strong-headed
but patriotic&mdash;a loving kiss and a vigorous
handshake, which will give you courage and sufficient
strength to do your duty as a good Frenchman. If you
obtain what I ask of you, write me immediately and I
will join my new regiment as soon as possible. Send
your reply to Eugène Escloupié, Evacué des Places de
Guerre, Maison Cross, Rue Aimée Dumaine."</p>

<p>I awaited the reply. On receiving it, my father told
me that the captain could not accept me, but he would
authorize me to follow his regiment when it was called
to the front.</p>

<p>I still impatiently await his departure for the field
of battle.</p>

<p><i>Tales of Valor in Battles of the Clouds</i></p>

<p><i>Told by the Fliers Themselves&mdash;and Eye-Witnesses</i></p>

<p>These are, indeed, days of the new knighthood. No knights of
old ever rode into the tournament with truer chivalry than the
modern knights of the air. Thousands of tales could be told of
them&mdash;for each flight is another Great Adventure. The gallant
Italians in their flights over the Alps have surpassed the bravery
of the old Romans. Among them are such men as D'Annunzio,
the Italian poet. The Americans, British, Russians&mdash;throughout
the armies of the Allies, these knights of the airships have met
the knights of Germany and Austria in death-struggles in the
clouds. It is not possible here to call the "roll of honor" of
Guynemer, Nungesser, Navarre, Chaput, Chainat, Dorme, Lenoir,
Rochefort Heurteaux&mdash;and a host of others. Only a few stories
can be told of the chivalry of the Frenchmen to symbolize the
staunch hearts of all the men who battle in the clouds.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF GUYNEMER&mdash;LAST FLIGHT OF
FRENCH DARE-DEVIL</p>

<p>The dashing Guynemer, King of the Airmen, has made
his last sensational "down," a victim of a German plane.
"Ace of the Aces" has been missing since the latter part
of September, 1917. When last observed he was engaged,
single-handed, with a squadron of enemy planes
numbering more than forty, and the last official communication
in regard to him read: "Although all means
of investigation have been tried, we have not obtained
any further information." And so it is feared that Capt.
Georges Guynemer, the eagle of the birdmen, the Frenchman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
with the face of a woman and heart of a lion, has
fought his last battle in the clouds.</p>

<p>Guynemer was one of the youngest men of his rank
in the French Army, having been appointed by President
Poincaré in February at the age of twenty-two. It was
his custom to operate alone, handling the wheel of his
machine as well as his gun, and his wonderful aerial conquests
made him a hero throughout France. All his
short life he had been an invalid with a tendency to
tuberculosis, and, believing that he would not live long,
he determined to give his life to his country in a manner
that would enable him to first accomplish the utmost to
her advantage. A comrade thus described his last
flight....</p>

<p>"Guynemer sighted five machines of the Albatross type
<i>D-3</i>. Without hesitating, he bore down on them. At that
moment enemy patrolling machines, soaring at a great
height, appeared suddenly and fell upon Guynemer.</p>

<p>"There were forty enemy machines in the air at this
time, including Count von Richthofen and his circus division
of machines, painted in diagonal blue and white
stripes. Toward Guynemer's right some Belgian machines
hove in sight, but it was too late.</p>

<p>"Guynemer must have been hit. His machine dropped
gently toward the earth, and I lost track of it. All that
I can say is that the machine was not on fire."</p>

<p>Guynemer was last cited in the French official announcement
of September 10, 1917, for having won his
fiftieth aerial victory. In an unofficial dispatch a few
days before he was said to have accounted for fifty-two
enemy planes. His German rival for the war-honors of
the air, Baron von Richthofen, is credited with seventy
"downs." But the German method of scoring such engagements
differs materially from that of the French, inasmuch
as a French aviator, in order to get credit for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
victory, must send his victim's plane to destruction in sight
of two official observers, while a German scores if he
but send a bullet through his adversary's motor, forcing
him to glide to the earth.</p>

<p>Guynemer had a fine courage as well as bravery, and a
determined spirit that obtained for him entrance into the
Army after he had been several times rejected for lack
of sufficient physique....</p>

<p>Captain Guynemer was only twenty-three years old. He
was born on Christmas day, 1893, the son of a prosperous
manufacturer of Compiègne, who had been a captain
in the French Army. All his brief life he had been an
invalid, very tall and very slender, even showing a leaning
toward tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Under tutors Georges had studied to enter the Ecole
Polytechnique of Paris, but was rejected because of his
frail health. The professors did not believe he could live
to finish the course, so why waste the time with him?
His parents had taken the youth to Biarritz for his health,
and they had been there a year when the Great War
started. Five times the young man tried to enlist as a
private in the French Army and each time he was rejected
because of his health.</p>

<p>Certain there was something he could do for his country,
young Guynemer volunteered for work in the aeroplane
factories. His natural bent was mechanics and his
progress was rapid. His superiors recognized the thorough
elementary education he had. He had studied in
England for two years and made a tour of the world in
search of health, but always studying. He remained for
a time in the United States.</p>

<p>Soon Georges Guynemer became a mechanician at the
military aviation-fields, and there his work and his personal
character so impressed the officers that he was permitted
to enlist as a student aviator. That was his chance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and he made more of it than any other aviator ever did.
He obtained a pilot's license in January, 1916, and as a
sergeant made his first flight in an <i>avion de chasse</i>.</p>

<p>In less than three weeks he had brought down his fifth
enemy aeroplane, thus becoming an Ace and earning an
official citation. From the first his career was, perhaps,
more active than that of any other aviator along the battle-front.
His most spectacular feat, for which he was
made a lieutenant and decorated with the Cross of War,
was on September 29 last year, when he rose in the air
to defend a comrade of his <i>escadrille</i> who had been attacked
by five German <i>Fokkers</i>.</p>

<p>At a height of more than 10,000 feet Captain Guynemer
shot and dropped two of the Germans within thirty
seconds of each other. He then pursued the three others,
and in two minutes had shot down his third enemy
machine. He was pursuing the remaining two <i>Fokkers</i>
when an enemy shell exploded under his aeroplane and
tore away one wing.</p>

<p>"I felt myself dropping," he said later. "It was 10,000
feet to the earth. I pulled and pushed every lever I had,
but nothing would check my terrific descent. Five thousand
feet from the earth the wrecked machine began to
turn somersaults, but I was strapped into the seat. I do
not know what it was, but something happened and I
felt the speed descent lessen. But suddenly there was
a tremendous crash, and when I recovered my senses I
had been taken from the wreckage and was all right."</p>

<p>Three times Captain Guynemer was wounded in battle,
but each time slightly.</p>

<p>Many stories are told which illustrate the importance
which the Germans attached to his flights and their efforts
to "down" the fearless aviator. H. Massac Buist tells
this story:</p>

<p>"A distinct feature of the French aviation service in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
1917 is its treatment of 'star turns.' One of the most
brilliant is a man who has been shot several times, whose
nerves are seemingly of steel, and whose skill rather increases
than diminishes with the number of occasions on
which he issues from hospital.</p>

<p>"He is attached to no particular squadron. Instead, he
is free to go of his own sweet will to any part of the
front, from the Belgian coast to the Swiss frontier. The
Germans attach so much importance to him that they follow
his progress from point to point.</p>

<p>"One day the champion pilot elected to come where the
British were. Within twenty-four hours of his arrival the
enemy were on the alert for him. The Germans sent up
ten machines to catch him. Single-handed he set out for
them, and promptly brought down three.</p>

<p>"He travels in his personal automobile with his <i>chef</i>.
The aeroplane he uses is always specially built to his own
ideas. It is fitted with all manner of peculiar contrivances.
When not engaging the enemy, in flying hours,
it is his habit to take every opportunity to practise behind
the scenes."</p>

<p>The story of the young airman's persistent and finally
successful efforts to enter the aviation service is here
told....</p>

<p>"One of the members of the <i>N-3</i> spoke to me of the
early days when Guynemer was so nearly driven away
from the gates of the aerodrome.</p>

<p>"You should have seen him, eh? A stripling of nineteen
who knew how to fly and insisted. He was just from
the <i>lycée</i>; he had been rejected four times, but he insisted
and he came to Pau to the aerodrome. <i>Eh bien</i>,
they let him in at last, and I will tell you what he did.
I went up with him once, after we were both aces, to get
some photographs, because I understand photography.
And the last thing he said to me was: 'Old fellow, I give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
you warning. To-day I dodge no shells. To-day is my
anniversary.'</p>

<p>"Well, we went up and they recognized him&mdash;they always
do, because he flies like no one else in the world.
Never have I heard such a cracking of shells. They
started in a big circle all around us and came nearer and
nearer, but he did not move. On the course he kept, and
I&mdash;took photographs. At last I report that I have
enough; but, no, he asks me to take some photographs
of the puffy clouds around our plane. And when that is
done he starts home again, but turns again and does a
spiral, I do not know how many times, right over one
of the batteries which had been looking for us. In the
line they thought he was crazy. But I knew well enough
that Guynemer was paying us out for his early days when
we dared to patronize him!"</p>

<p>Guynemer's development was coincident with that of
the light aircraft of the <i>Nieuport</i> type. In the little machine
with the clipped wings that must take the earth at
sixty miles an hour because it has no buoyancy at a lesser
speed, Guynemer was at home. He won his "aceship" in
a slower type, but his developed tactics required a craft
that could make its 10,000 feet in ten minutes, and maintain
a speed of 120 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Estimates based on the carrying capacity of the machines
that Guynemer destroyed credit the captain with
accounting for more than eighty pilots, observers, and
gunners, all told. It was Guynemer who shot down Lieutenant
Hohendorf, pilot for a French aeroplane factory
before the war, who had destroyed twelve French machines.
It is not impossible that Guynemer himself was
an unfortunate victim added to the record of Richthofen's
squad.</p>

<p>II&mdash;STORY OF DORCIERES&mdash;DUELLIST OF
THE CLOUDS</p>

<p>For a generation Rouzier Dorcieres has been one of
the most picturesque figures in Parisian life, holding the
unique position of the dean of duellists. A dinner was
given to him in April, 1911, by two hundred and fifty
men, every one of whom had either fought a duel with
him, been his or his opponent's second in a duel, been
seconded by him, or had participated as principal or second
in a duel he "directed." All told, he had been director
of 267 sword or pistol combats, and of the occasions
on which he had played the rôle of second he had completely
lost count. He himself had fought no fewer than
twenty-five duels, fifteen with the sword and ten with the
pistol.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, then, that such a firebrand volunteered
to serve France in arms when the war broke out,
though he had passed the age limit set by the order of
mobilization. Bulletins announced that fact at the time,
and added that he had been attached to the aviation service.
Bulletins equally brief announced that Dorcieres
was "missing"&mdash;presumably either dead or wounded. No
further details have been given of his fate until this story
of the dramatic end of a remarkable man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the night of August 2, 1914, Dorcieres and a few
of his old cronies&mdash;old because all of the younger men
who had consorted with him were mustered into the
Army&mdash;gathered at their table in their favorite café.</p>

<p>"My friends," said Dorcieres, as calmly as though he
had been announcing that he was going to Deauville for a
holiday at the seaside, "I bid you farewell. To-night I
am going to volunteer as a soldier of France.</p>

<p>"You may wonder why, at the age of thirty-nine, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
voluntarily enlist in the Army, and why I choose to enter
the aviation service, distinctly the place for a youth. Listen,
then. You have always believed that I have never
suffered an affront in my life that was not avenged. But
there was one time when I was insulted&mdash;grossly&mdash;and
the man who did it escaped me. Do you remember the
winter, five years ago, that I passed in Switzerland? It
was there, when I was stopping in Zurich, that the thing
occurred. It was after dinner, when the man sitting next
to me nudged my shoulder.</p>

<p>"'So you are Rouzier Dorcieres,' he said. 'I recognize
you. And they say you have never been touched in a
duel. Well, I am sorry I have never had the good fortune
to meet you in one.' Then he laughed a sneering
laugh.</p>

<p>"My blood boiled. 'But you will have the chance to
meet me to-morrow morning,' I replied, glaring at him
for his insolence. And then as I surveyed his countenance
I saw the answer for his piggishness. He was a
Prussian.</p>

<p>"'No,' he answered me, 'I will not be able to avail myself
of the pleasure of measuring swords with you, as I
leave for Germany on the midnight train. I am attached
to the Imperial Aviation Corps and must report at Johannisthal
to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"I looked at my watch. It was but a few minutes after
eight o'clock. 'Then I will teach you your lesson to-night,'
I told him.</p>

<p>"'Monsieur,' he said, 'I shall meet you here before ten
o'clock with my seconds and the swords. We will settle
this affair before I depart.'</p>

<p>"I bowed with pleasure as he stalked from the restaurant.
And then whom did I see sitting near me but our
old friend, the Comte de B&mdash;&mdash;, as fine a second as any
man ever had. In a few words I had recounted the incident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and called on him to act in my behalf. I waited in
that restaurant with the Comte until eleven o'clock. The
Prussian officer did not appear. Two years afterward I
read in a dispatch from Berlin of his being brevetted as
an aviator in the Kaiser's service, and recently I read of
how he was working in the air-service of the German
Army.</p>

<p>"That is why I enter the aviation service of France.
Because I still hope to meet him and make him repay his
debt of honor to me."</p>

<p>Dorcieres went to the front to seek in the air the only
man who had ever insulted him and failed to pay the
price. His pilot, the aviator who operated the aeroplane
in which he fought his last duel, told the rest of the story
to Dorcieres's friends long after the official bulletins had
announced his death:</p>

<p>"He told me to find you, messieurs, and to tell you just
what he told me as he lay dying&mdash;dying from eleven machine-gun
bullets which riddled his torso in that last combat
which nearly cost me, also, my life.</p>

<p>"Rouzier Dorcieres was the strangest machine-gunner
I ever had with me. Unlike other gunners, he always carried
binoculars, and when we sighted and approached a
<i>Boche</i> aeroplane he spent his preliminary time in peering
intently at the occupants of the enemy machine instead of
preparing and testing his mitrailleuse anxiously as most
gunners do.</p>

<p>"As we circled near the German machine in his last
flight Dorcieres passed me a scrap of paper. On it he
had scrawled a request that I swoop past the German as
near as I could. Instantly I divined his reason&mdash;and
his reason for always carrying and using his high-power
glasses. He thought he recognized one of the occupants
of the other aeroplane.</p>

<p>"I swerved and doubled and shot past the <i>Fokker's</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
tail. Dorcieres's eyes had been riveted to the glasses,
but he dropped them now, heedlessly, and they smashed
in the bottom of the fuselage.</p>

<p>"Dorcieres's right hand was on the mitrailleuse-trigger
and his left was feeding the cartridge-belt cleanly into
the loading-chamber as we rounded and flashed by,
abreast, but a little higher, than the enemy.</p>

<p>"Taca-tac-pouf-pouf-taca-tac-pouf-pouf&mdash;and he drove
thirty rounds at the <i>Fokker</i>. And then as I swerved the
<i>Boche</i> turned upward and let fly at us. He had been
traveling faster than I thought, because my mind had
been distracted by approaching too near him at Dorcieres's
request, and he reached us with every shot from
his machine gun. Our fuselage cracked and splintered
as the leaden hail perforated the car and the choking gasps
that I heard behind me were the positive indications that
my gunner had been hit. I, too, turned upward, as my
motor was undamaged and climbed with the German.
Then we both planed and approached each other. I
heard my mitrailleuse begin to spit at the exact fraction
of a second that we came within range, and the enemy
gun never once barked a reply. Dorcieres's first shot
must have killed the enemy gunner. And his torrent of
bullets ripped off the tail of the <i>Fokker</i> and it dived
into our lines like a stone, nose down.</p>

<p>"I landed within fifty yards of the broken <i>Boche</i> car
and its occupants. Two stretchers were waiting there
for us, but I was unhurt, miraculously. We put Dorcieres
in one, tenderly as a baby, and then started off.
But he had seen the wreck of the <i>Fokker</i> there and he
begged that we stop beside it.</p>

<p>"Beside the German machine were the pilot and the
gunner, both dead. By a superhuman effort my dying
gunner raised himself on his elbow. He gazed at the
face of the enemy machine-gunner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"'It is he,' was all he said. And we carried him to
the field-hospital.</p>

<p>"That afternoon I went to see him. He was pretty
nearly gone. That is when he explained, and that is
when he asked me to convey to you, messieurs, this message&mdash;that
he had avenged his honor."</p>

<p>These stories of the aviators could be told indefinitely;
how they met in mortal combats in the clouds; how they
act as sky-pilots for the armies; how they raided the
Krupp gun works; how they soar over the navies, but
they must be left for future volumes for they are creating
a history of their own&mdash;one of the most remarkable
in the annals of war.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FOUR AMERICAN PRISONERS
ABOARD THE YARROWDALE</h2></div>

<p><i>Adventures With the German Raider "Moewe"</i></p>

<p><i>Told by Dr. Orville E. McKim, Survivor of the
Sunken "Georgic"</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the dramatic story of the four American surgeons,
starved in German prisons, whose demand for release by President
Wilson nearly resulted in a declaration of war against
Germany. Few more dramatic tales have been brought forth
than the story of adventure, hardship and peril at sea, short
commons on land and the new danger from the sky which was
related by four American professional men. Snapped up by
the German raider in mid-ocean, they cruised around for days
while the commerce destroyer was gathering in further prizes.
Then they made the voyage in the <i>Yarrowdale</i> to Swinemunde,
under such conditions that they expected the ship's seams to
open and the vessel to sink beneath them at any moment. They
lived for more than two months in prison camps in Germany,
on the meagre prison fare provided by the German government.
This is the record of how the Americans of the <i>Yarrowdale</i>, by
enduring hunger, deprivation, cold, despair, and days of pitiless
imprisonment, wrote their names in the annals of the United
States. It is romantic, for the elements of daring naval adventure
and of international diplomacy are present. Ambassador
Gerard, after several communications to the Wilhelmstrasse,
which were more than energetic, was promised the release of
the Americans, and the threatened declaration of war on this
issue was averted. Dr. McKim, an American veterinarian, was
aboard the White Star liner <i>Georgic</i>, in charge of twelve hundred
horses for the Allies, when she was sunk by the German
raider <i>Moewe</i> during its romantic exploits. He was taken to
Germany, with the other prisoners, on the <i>Yarrowdale</i>. Dr.
Snyder was captured aboard the British steamship <i>Voltaire</i>, the
first vessel to be captured by the raider, while he was returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to America from France. Mr. Zabriskie was the veterinarian
on the steamship <i>Mount Temple</i>, a Canadian horse transport,
which lost three men from shell fire. Dr. Davis and Dr. McKim
were on the White Star liner <i>Georgic</i>, the most important bag
of the German raider. Dr. McKim was the first of the Americans
to return and related his experiences in the New York
<i>World</i>&mdash;Copyright 1917 by the John N. Wheeler Syndicate. A
few episodes from his adventures are now retold.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;"MY FIRST NIGHT ON GERMAN RAIDER"</p>

<p>The first night on board the German raider which had
sunk the <i>Georgic</i> (when we were hurled into a sea alive
with swimming, drowning horses) was hell. That is the
only way to describe it, if you will pardon the expression.
At 9 o'clock all lights were put out. Even the tiny bulb
that illuminated the compass on the navigating bridge
was shielded and not so much as a match was allowed
to be struck on the decks.</p>

<p>We were shut up in the forecastle, and we either had
to go to bed or sit around in the dark. The ship rolled
heavily and the propellers raced and pounded as her stern
occasionally lifted out of the water because of the high
speed at which she was constantly pushed. Nobody knew
where we were nor where we were going.</p>

<p>With the others, I lay down on a hard, thin mattress,
stuffed with excelsior, in the middle of the floor, and
envied the men who had bunks or hammocks. Each of
us had a shoddy blanket which was as damp as it was
dirty and smelly. My bones ached from the cold when
at last what seemed an endless night was over.</p>

<p>A sailor who had been detailed as a steward for us
brought a mixture masquerading under the name of coffee
and more of the black bread and beet jam. There seemed
to be no end of bread, and Dr. Snider, who had been
surgeon on the <i>Voltaire</i>, ate chunk after chunk of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"How can you swallow all that stuff?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"When you've been on this d&mdash;&mdash; ship as long as I
have, you'll know," he said. And before I got out of
Germany I did.</p>

<p>I had no sooner eaten a few scraps of breakfast than
the coffee nauseated me as it had the night before, and
my frugal meal and I promptly parted company. As
I returned to the quarters where the other men were I
started to "beef" about my troubles. Immediately they
all broke into song. The tune was that of the hymn,
"Holy, Holy, Holy," and the words were:</p>

<div class="poem">
"Growling, growling, growling!<br />
You're always bally well growling.<br />
When you're dead and in your grave<br />
You'll bally well growl no more!"<br />
</div>

<p>I didn't quite sense the meaning of it at first, and when
they were through singing I started to explain once more
that I couldn't stand the coffee out of that infernal,
sickening receptacle, looking very much like a wash basin.
I hadn't got six words out of my mouth when the song
broke out again, and this time the men in the adjacent
forecastle room joined in, and I think every English-speaking
voice on board the ship was roaring those words.
I knew then what it meant, and never after that did I
utter one word of complaint. If anybody did, the song
was sure to drown his voice. That song might serve a
purpose here.</p>

<p>At 10 o'clock in the morning we were led to a washroom,
four men at a time. All we had was running salt
water and no soap. It drove the dirt in further, but
nevertheless it was refreshing.</p>

<p>Many of the men who had been on the raider for a
long time were utterly despondent. The treatment to
which they had been subjected in the vile-smelling compartments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the lack of decent food and the uncertainty of
everything had broken their spirit. Little groups sat
about the deck when we were up for our morning airing,
their heads in their hands and their shoulders bent and
hunched like those of aged men.</p>

<p>A few tried to keep up the spirits of the others. I
will never forget Chief Officer Evans of the Voltaire.
He had been very stout but he was losing weight at an
alarming rate. His features were pinched and his skin
hung in folds, yet he was always joking and singing and
cheering up the men. It was enough to crack nerves of
steel.</p>

<p>Picture us. Some of us have nothing to our backs but
pajamas and overcoats in which we left the <i>Georgic</i>.
Some of my horsemen have nothing but shirt and
trousers, even their socks having been left behind because
they were working on the main deck which was awash
when the raider fired into us.</p>

<p>None of us expects to reach home! The raider is
heavily armed and her officers are brave men. They will
tackle anything. Sooner or later it is inevitable we will
encounter a British or a French cruiser&mdash;and then we
will die. We won't be fighting like men. Down there in
those rat traps with steel doors bolted against us, we will
drown while others are fighting. The fellows who sit
around the deck with their heads in their hands moaning,
sometimes even sobbing, are not cowards. All they would
ask is a chance to die like men. A man doesn't want to
go like a drowned rat.</p>

<p>After our little breath of fresh air in the mornings, it
seemed worse than ever to go back to that hole&mdash;the forecastle.
There was just one doubtful cause for thankfulness.
We officers, as I was rated, were not in quite
as bad a situation as were the men. About 430 of them
in all were packed below decks in a hold that smelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the high heavens with air so laden with soggy, stale tobacco
smoke that you could cut it with a knife. The
mattresses, which most of them spread on the floor for
beds, were made of old cotton waste, and they absorbed
filth and dampness like sponges. As for food, the men
got sea biscuit for breakfast instead of the black bread&mdash;and
they were some biscuits. They were as hard as the
decks we slept on. For this noon-day meal they were
given noodle soup, such as we received, only thinner, and
more watery if possible, but they seldom got meat, although
we had it nearly every day with a very tasty
gravy poured over it.</p>

<p>For the first two days this noon-day meal was the
only one I could retain, and I think it was because there
was none of that abominable coffee with it. Our manner
of eating was somewhat difficult too, for we were given
spoons and forks but no knives.</p>

<p>"That's so, you can't file them down and make daggers,"
explained one of the German sailors. "We aren't
taking any chances with neutrals or belligerents either."
They weren't. We could readily see that. Of course one
of the first things the Germans had done when we went
aboard was to take away every firearm or weapon of
any character and whatever might have been used to
flash a signal to a vessel the raider might pursue or try
to elude.</p>

<p>The commander's order was:</p>

<p>"Any man found with firearms or heliograph will be
shot summarily." Nobody tried to hold anything out on
him after that. The Germans mean what they say.</p>

<p>Every neutral was given a white band to wear around
his left arm, and this allowed us more liberty than the
other men and officers enjoyed. The belligerents were
all obliged to take their air and exercise on the well deck
aft, while we were allowed to go up on the head while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
on deck. I talked to many of the German sailors, and
it was one of them who told me how the <i>Georgic</i> had
been taken.</p>


<p>II&mdash;"WHAT THE OFFICERS TOLD ME"</p>

<p>"We are sneaking along at night," he said in very fair
English. He told me later he had once been on a Hamburg-American
merchantman regularly out of New
York. "We haven't a light showing. The ship's as black
as the water around us, and there's not a pipe or a cigar
lit on the deck.</p>

<p>"All of a sudden the lookout calls and we see your
lights. Keeping them low on the horizon we steam along
all night waiting for daylight to run in on you. After
that it was simple. You know what happened then. (I
certainly did know.) What fools you were to run with
lights!"</p>

<p>One of the officers from the <i>Voltaire</i>, already taken
and sunk, told me that afterward while the Germans
were chasing us a sailor went below and informed the
prisoners that the raider was overhauling the White Star
steamship <i>Georgic</i>. The name had been chipped off the
<i>Georgic's</i> counter and lifeboats and the only conceivable
way they could have identified us was by intercepting
wireless messages. For that, they must have had the
British code. The incident lends color to the story that
the Germans had the code when the <i>Lusitania</i> made her
last trip and sent a message to the Captain to slow down
to eighteen knots. There are many stories among seamen
in England to-day that Capt. Turner of the <i>Lusitania</i>
punished at least one member of his crew for treachery
before he abandoned his ship.</p>

<p>"When we came aboard the raider," the officer from the
late <i>Voltaire</i> continued, "one of the Germans said to me:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Where were you? You are twenty-four hours late.'</p>

<p>"And we were. It's a cinch those Fritzies never
dreamt that. They pick code messages."</p>

<p>I had heard the raider was equipped with both coal
and oil burning engines, so I managed to wander into
the engine room to try to see how they were arranged
while I was out for an airing one day. I hadn't had
much time to look around when a heavy hand clutched my
shoulder and a German sailor sent me spinning out of the
doorway.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we neutrals were allowed a great deal of
freedom, and I want to say that what I did discover
showed me that the raider was about as cleverly arranged
a ship as I have ever seen. While on the forecastle
head for airings, I noticed that there were always six
men on the bridge. This was an unusual circumstance,
but it would be difficult to note it from a distance because
the men on the bridge were partially concealed behind
a canvas windshield.</p>

<p>There were always two lookouts in the crow's nest and
sailors told me they only stood one hour watches each.
This insured wide awake, alert men all the time. I
noticed these scanners used telescopes most of the time,
which gave them a longer range of vision than would
binoculars.</p>

<p>There were always three operators in the wireless
room&mdash;no chance of treachery there. One was continually
listening to pick up messages and one was ready
to "jam the air" should any vessel the raider was pursuing
attempt to send out a message. Not a single ship
ever got a message into the air because the raider jammed
every one of them. This was accomplished by a noisy
and continuous, disjointed sending, like a sputtering
gossip of the sea.</p>

<p>Personally I saw seven guns and four torpedo tubes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
on the raider. She may have had more but I doubt it.
They were quite sufficient for any merchant ship she
might encounter.</p>


<p>III&mdash;"OUR TERRIBLE DAYS ON THE
'YARROWDALE'"</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Dec. 13, four hundred of us prisoners
were transferred to the <i>Yarrowdale</i> which had been
cruising around in the wake of the raider ever since she
was captured. A few provisions having been brought
over from the raider, we parted company, and I was
mighty glad to see the last of her. I didn't know then
what was awaiting me in Germany.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Yarrowdale</i> eighteen German guards
under Lieut. Barowitz were responsible for four hundred
and sixty-two men, many of whom were belligerents.</p>

<p>I have often heard people laugh at the idea of less
than a score of men subduing and holding several hundred,
and taking a ship into port under such conditions.
Just listen to our predicament:</p>

<p>On the <i>Yarrowdale's</i> bridge, one at either end, are
two bombs, each of them large and powerful enough to
sink the ship. Lanyards are arranged so that the commander
can lower them over the side and explode them,
almost with a single movement of the hand.</p>

<p>In the engine room, placed at the most vital points,
are three bombs just as big and just as powerful. The
German in command of the engine room has orders to
explode all three the second he receives a signal from the
bridge which has been agreed upon.</p>

<p>Beside the bombs, there are several boxes of hand
grenades, always guarded by one of the German sailors
who is heavily armed. There never are less than three
Germans on the bridge&mdash;Barowitz, whom I believe to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
crazy as a March hare, usually sleeps there, if he ever
sleeps at all&mdash;and with these deadly weapons they could
quickly quell any disturbance which might arise on the
deck by literally blowing us to pieces. If we should
succeed in overpowering the guards, Barowitz will blow
the vessel up.</p>

<p>The food was a little better than on the raider. As
soon as we were on board, Lieut. Barowitz "signed up"
the Norwegian crew of the steamship <i>Hallbjourg</i>, and
it was they who manned the vessel. He then informed
us that we would be obliged to shift for ourselves so far
as the commissary was concerned.</p>

<p>"There is enough food for twenty-six days," he said.
"And it has got to last twenty-six days. And be careful
that you don't skimp the German guards. If you try
to hold out food on them you'll find yourselves with
worse troubles than starvation."</p>

<p>And this cheerful admonition was carried out to the
letter, you may be sure, for Barowitz was a devil in uniform.
No matter how long I may live, I shall never forget
the first two nights on this madman's ship. The
German guards tell us that Barowitz never leaves the
bridge. He doesn't sleep and he scarcely eats. He must
be trying to get to a certain point by a certain time, or
cross some imaginary line before a certain time. His
German seamen don't know just what his idea is any
more than we do.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;"I AM ON A CRAZY SHIP WITH A CRAZY
SKIPPER"</p>

<p>I have seen terrific storms at sea. I have been on
ships where the floor of the saloon was awash for days
and nights at a time, but never before have I been frightened.
I am on this crazy ship with a crazy skipper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Straight into the teeth of a ninety-mile gale we are driving
ahead at a speed which must be at least nine knots.
This is tremendous for a vessel like the <i>Yarrowdale</i>.
Continually she sticks her nose down, and her tail comes
out of the sea and quivers as the propellers spin. The
boilers never got below 220. Barowitz meant what he
said. He knocked his own men down just as cheerfully
as he did his prisoners&mdash;frequently it seemed even
more so.</p>

<p>After seemingly endless days on what had become a
ship of terror, we sighted Iceland. It was so cold and
rainy most of the time that we had not been able to take
our airing on deck, but from the time we sighted Iceland
we were not allowed above, anyway. For four or five
days and nights we jockeyed around. Whenever we
sighted a light at night or smoke in the day-time we turned
and ran.</p>

<p>We were likely to be fired on at any moment by a
British patrol boat or a submarine. We knew we were
more than likely to bump a British mine, and as we
could not display our colors a German submarine might
sink us without warning&mdash;as they have been known to
do. Finally, there were the German mine fields ahead
of us. At last one morning Barowitz came down into
our quarters. His face glowed all over and he rubbed his
hands with glee, for all the world like a money lender who
had just driven a hard bargain.</p>

<p>"We have got through the British patrol," he said.
And it seemed to give him more satisfaction to taunt us
with the information than it did to accomplish his
purpose.</p>

<p>From that time on the attitude of Barowitz and his
men changed toward all Americans on board. Until then
he had acted with some restraint and the German sailors
had been very friendly and courteous. Now that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
were nearing the Fatherland, they treated us with the
greatest disdain and superciliousness, heaped abuse on us
and called us American "swinehunds," which meant dirty
dogs.</p>

<p>Well, about 9 o'clock one night we passed Bergen
Light, and, in the morning were lying in Ore-Sund which
separates Denmark and Sweden. We were certainly in
neutral waters, for the sound was only three miles wide,
with Sweden on one side and Denmark on the other.
Imagine, then, our amazement when a German patrol
steamed alongside and made fast.</p>

<p>That night I did not sleep a wink. All night long we
would go ahead a little distance then back off, then ahead
once more, sometimes at full speed, sometimes very
slowly. If I had known what awaited us I think I
would have preferred to strike one of the German mines.
But we didn't, and shortly after daybreak we slid into
the harbor at Swinemunde, and the crew of the <i>Yarrowdale</i>
received one of the greatest naval ovations I have
ever witnessed. Flags were dipped in salute, guns were
fired and whistles shrieked. Barowitz went ashore and
was feasted and feted. I saw later in a German paper
he was decorated and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant.</p>

<p>What happened after we went ashore is subject for
future stories. There had been blood curdling experiences
on board the <i>Yarrowdale</i>. They were child's play
compared to what we endured in Germany.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HUMORS OF THE EAST AFRICAN
CAMPAIGN</h2></div>

<p><i>Told by "A. E. M. M."</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Here is an amusing account of the human side of the campaign
that ended the existence of German East Africa as a Hun colony.
Told in the <i>Wide World Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;WITH THE AFRICAN MOUNTED RIFLES</p>

<p>"Sahib," said a man of an Indian mountain battery,
when we were in standing camp in the shadow of Kilimanjaro,
"you are obviously not infantry, and you are as
certainly not cavalry. What <i>are</i> you?"</p>

<p>That was a question I had often asked myself since
the day I enrolled as a signaller in the East African
Mounted Rifles, locally known as "Bowker's Horse"&mdash;a
deceptive nickname, for at that time we rode mules.
We got horses later on, and uniforms and accoutrements
all of a piece; but in the early days of the war we were
an irregular corps of straight-shooting, cheery, undisciplined
scallywags, wearing garments of our own devising,
saluting or not as the notion occurred to us, and literally
pawing the ground in our simple-minded anxiety to ride
straight into "German East" and crumple up such slight
resistance as we expected to meet. The corps was composed,
for the most part, of settlers, a sprinkling of juniors
from Government offices, an estate agent or two, and
a leavening of those nondescripts who float round any
new colony, to be inevitably washed up when any piece
of adventure or devilry comes along.</p>

<p>That was how we looked at it then; we were booked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
for the great adventure, and were prepared to start on
it out of hand with our own rifles and ammunition and
a few scrag-ends of mule.</p>

<p>For some days after the declaration of war Nairobi
looked as it does in race week, and I wonder someone
didn't get killed in the crush at Mackinnon's Corner,
where all the principal roads converge. White men,
brown men, black men, motors, bicycles, and mules
seethed about all over the crossing. Somalis would bring
up a batch of mules to be passed by the vet., and those
would kick and bite their way through the maelstrom,
whilst our local scorchers, who had blossomed into motorcycle
despatch-riders, added to the joy of things by coming
down Sixth Avenue like streaks and jamming on
both brakes when within a few feet of the crush. This
pleased the mules, of course.</p>

<p>It was an education to watch some of our bar-room
buck-jumpers at play on the lightsome blend of fiend and
whirlwind called a mule. There was a man in my troop
called Eccles, who wasn't a "Buffalo Bill" at the best of
times, and they served him out a mustard-crossed white
mule that looked like some kind of loathsome slug. It
kicked you when you tried to mount, and promptly bucked
you off if you succeeded in getting on&mdash;a <i>perfect</i> brute,
in short.</p>

<p>Eccles's first experience was at a parade in Government
Road, when the mule took him out in front of the
troop, deposited him on the hard road, and then capered
about him, apparently undecided whether to trample on
him or eat him. When we got out into camp the mule
developed a habit of lying down in every stream or bit
of water we crossed, and after a few days of this sort of
thing Eccles decided to lead his mule. One morning,
however, the animal disappeared into the blue, to the
huge delight of Eccles, until a heliogram came through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
from the next camp to say that the mule had arrived
there. Eccles scarcely spoke for two days. We sent a
couple of Somali scouts over, and they, five Europeans,
and a crowd of porters spent a futile morning in trying
to catch the brute.</p>

<p>Then our regiment commandeered all the mules and
horses from that camp. This one refused to be caught,
but attached itself to the corps, and, as we could neither
catch it nor get rid of it, both Eccles and the mule enjoyed
complete happiness.</p>


<p>II&mdash;THE MULE AS A COMRADE</p>

<p>The study of the gentle mule, as a matter of fact,
occupied most of the first part of our time with the
regiment. We camped along the railway line, and the
entraining of mules is one of the most exciting pastimes
I know, although the procedure is simple enough. One
man leads the mule up to the door of the horse-box, whilst
two others link arms across its hindquarters and heave
or push it on board before it has had time to realize their
intention. Sometimes it realizes first, and then heartless
spectators gather round and yell with joy at the stirring
scene. The man who pulls at the bridle has a busy time,
for if the box is nearly full when he packs his steed in
he has to quit through a storm of hoofs and teeth, and
I've caught fragments of conversation on these occasions
that would turn a dock-laborer green with envy.</p>

<p>Mules are utter hypocrites. There is no animal living
that can assume an expression of such injured innocence
as a mule when he has "done you down" properly. When,
at the end of the first round of that exciting bout miscalled
"stables," you abandon currycomb and brush and
pause to consider the possibilities of the situation, your
mount gazes at you more in sorrow than in anger, suggesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
that <i>he</i> is the stranger in a pest-ridden country,
and that he merely acted in self-defence. Of course,
grooming is a painful process for both parties, for unless
the beasts have been well sprayed with disinfectant
beforehand, the clustered fauna of Africa display a desperate
tenacity. The insect pests were, by the way, one
of the chief features of the East African campaign;
after patrol we used to feel as if we wanted spraying
ourselves.</p>

<p>Pack-mules provide some exacting moments when you
are moving camp in a hurry. On our forced march into
Aruscha&mdash;a matter of some seventy-five miles, with short
intervals for food and sleep&mdash;the dawn of one day found
us enticing some of the dear things over plank bridges
laid across a ravine. There was a nightmare suggestion
about the scene that only Sime could have done justice
to; for it was still too dark to see to the bottom of the
ravine, and the swaying bridges seemed to stretch into
eternity.</p>

<p>Our first camp was in a bit of the Southern Game
Reserve&mdash;a lovely place. The signallers were perched
on a rocky peak, surrounded by clumps of low hills, which
merged into stretches of plain, covered with thorn scrub.
After rain the hills used to turn to a heavenly blue, with
shifting lights of mauve and purple as the cloud shadows
slid over them, and we could see Meru, which we then
looked upon as the first place we had to take, a jagged
and formidable peak; and, sometimes, when the air was
very clear, Kilimanjaro appeared like a big, flat-topped
cake with powdered sugar dusted over it.</p>


<p>III&mdash;FIGHTING WITH LIONS AND RHINO IN
JUNGLE LAND</p>

<p>At night a chill wind whooped down the valleys, and
we were smothered in swirls of damp mist. Lions roared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
nightly, and it was possible to stumble on a sleeping
rhino at any time of the day. They used to charge patrols
and disorganize them, and one of our fellows who had
strayed away from his troop met one face to face. His
mule streaked one way, he another, and the rhino nearly
broke his back in vamoosing in a third direction. The
trooper was lucky to have found the beast in a timid
mood, for the rhino's only amusement lies in chasing
unoffending sons of empire through thick thorn scrub,
though he's usually in too bad a temper to realize what
fun it is.</p>

<p>There is something peculiarly terrifying about a rhino
charge in the camp at night. You awake and jump to
safety all in a moment, impelled by the nightmare terror
that belongs to the time when fear ruled the world, and
the rash ancestor who slept on the ground made a spring
for the nearest branch on the approach of some primeval
monster.</p>

<p>We all have our affectations, and that of the old hand
was indifference to the game peril.</p>

<p>"You mustn't believe all the wild beasts stories you
hear," he would observe to the tenderfoot. "They are
mostly frightful exaggerations." Then the nervous one
would look up and observe a rhino gazing morosely at
these intruders on the privacy of his own special tract of
forest. The next moment the tenderfoot would be in the
arms of a peculiarly inhospitable tree, wondering what
was going to happen next. Certainly life in what the
kinema posters call "Nature's Zoo" holds excitements of
a kind unknown to the army in any other quarter of the
globe. I used to think out problems unprovided for by
the Hague Convention, such as, if a small British patrol
met a small enemy patrol in thick bush, and at the same
time flushed an angry rhino, what would be the correct
procedure? Should the combatants combine to blot out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the rhino, and then proceed with their own quarrel, or
should they hurriedly retire and fight somewhere else?
I never heard of any such contingency arising, but it
easily might have done so, and it is certain that once,
just as one of our patrols sighted a German patrol, a
rhino charged our rear, and two of our men had to fall
out to tackle it, whilst the rest fired on the Germans.</p>

<p>Our first engagement was at Longido, in the first November
of the war.</p>

<p>Our regiment had a tough day, and lay for many hours
under fire without food or water, but I am not out to
write the story of that skirmish. It doesn't come under
the heading of the humors of the campaign, although
there was a certain grim humor knocking about all the
same. Our men were so new to that sort of thing that
it took them some time to realize they were under heavy
fire, and just when the firing was hottest one of them
was waving a toothbrush and asking, "Any of you chaps
lost a toothbrush?" whilst another shouted, "Come over
here, you fellows. Lovely shooting!"</p>

<p>It was during the season that followed, when, as a
correspondent of an English paper neatly put it, we "held
the railway and shouted for help," that we realized the
real, inner meaning of monotony. At first we expected
to get going in a week, then we put the time forward to
months, and finally we resigned ourselves. To live in
standing camp for the rest of our natural lives, to do long
patrol, short patrol, and "bait" patrol for ever and ever
seemed the best we could hope of life. Letters arrived
with some regularity, for we were then only some few
miles over the border. Papers drifted through to us, and
we knew more of the happenings in Europe than we did
of our own campaign, though occasionally we gleaned
some items of local interest from the English papers. It
annoyed us to see an alleged illustration of one of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
"scraps," in which smart-looking men on ramping horses
were represented as fighting in open country at five hundred
yards, whilst in reality it was done by untidy men
on mules, in thick bush, at forty yards. The real thing
was much better than the artist's conception of it.</p>

<p>There are, as I have implied, three kinds of patrol&mdash;the
long patrol, on which you spend many days scouring
the burning veldt for Germans, and hoping you won't find
them; the short patrol, on which you spend one day doing
the same thing; and the "bait" patrol, on which you
spend the cold and cheerless hours before dawn wandering
round the camp and hoping the Germans won't
find <i>you</i>. On the latter it is the earnest desire of your
King and country that the noise of your getting shot will
alarm the camp before the attack takes place. If, on
these occasions, you meet a lion, or any vermin of that
kind, you must allow him to bash you on the head and
dine off your limbs rather than raise a false alarm. One
of our fellows met a lioness with cubs on one of these
cheery rambles, and was only saved by the fact that he
and his mule both froze stiff with terror, and baffled her
by not running away. He moved off slowly at last, and
she followed the patrol till dawn, obviously puzzled by
these strange beings.</p>

<p>Of long patrol your first intimation of the joy in store
for you usually is an excited clucking of the telephone
buzzer at 2 a. m. on a particularly joyless morning.
"Kaar-kuk-kuk! Kaar-kuk-kuk!" it observes, exactly
like a hen that has laid an egg. Of course, the obvious
thing to do is to fling a boot at the 'phone and go to
sleep; but we signallers have a strong sense of duty, so
we call the adjutant, who takes a mean revenge by telling
us to be saddled up in fifteen minutes and go out for
ten days to some "ticky" and waterless part of Africa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
which is, according to the 'phone, swarming with Germans.</p>

<p>The next ten minutes is spent in feverishly collecting
gear, with which you stagger through the night to your
disgusted steed, who, when he has realized what is in
store for him, behaves as though he had never seen you,
nor your saddle, nor the helio stand, nor anything that
is yours in his life before, this being his habit in all moments
of emergency. Then you take a few frantic tugs
at your cigarette before the "No smoking" order is passed
down, and ride out into the unknown.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;NIGHT RIDES OVER THE VELDT</p>

<p>Those night rides over the veldt were all alike. Your
vision was limited to the man in front of you, who was
a blurred shape that you, in a half-dream, were always
chasing and never coming up with. It was a dream that
seemed to go on for years and years, and then your mule
would stumble and bring you to your senses with a jerk.
In that light&mdash;for it is never very dark in Africa&mdash;men
appear as trees, and thorn bushes dismount and take aim
at you.</p>

<p>Dawn would find the whole patrol riding with eyes
glued to the horizon and lips closed on unlit cigarettes.
The order regarding smoking on those night-marches is
strict. Once when we were escorting a captured German
patrol, one of our men thoughtlessly lit up. One of the
prisoners promptly leaned over and said, in English:
"You mustn't do that; the enemy will see us."</p>

<p>The scenery was always the same there&mdash;rolling
stretches of sun-browned veldt, kopje upon kopje, wonderfully
shadowed, patches of thornscrub, and, clothing
the banks of rivers and streams, strips of forest; the
climate cold by night and hot by day. Africa is a queer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
baffling, changeable country. Exactly the same scene can
take on absolutely different aspects at different hours in
the day. The thorn-tree flowers into a white brush with
a sweet smell, and in the early morning, with a whitish
haze hanging over and a cool wind blowing, the country
seems beautiful and the trees appear as though laden
with apple blossoms. Yet, in the hard, hot light of midday,
with inky shadows outlined and the dust settling on
the trees, the same place is ugly and repellent. On these
patrols we moved by night, and failed to sleep by day,
because the patch of shade that will remain shaded for
even a few hours is non-existent. I usually woke to find
my body too hot to touch and my water-bottle on the
boil.</p>

<p>Later, when the South African forces came over and
we got going, we had easier times, could travel by day,
and lost that feeling of being little veldt-mice creeping
out of our holes.</p>

<p>Once patrol was over and we were "home" in camp,
we led a curious life, half soldier, half country gentleman.
We lived in roomy <i>bandas</i>, or grass huts, a section
in each, and as nearly every trooper had a "boy," or native
servant, our meals were brought to the <i>banda</i>, and we
clubbed together for luxuries. Also, we picked up our
own sections, so that if four pals elected to go through
the war together, they got the O. C. to fix it up.</p>

<p>Leave was the one thing that really mattered&mdash;those
ten glorious days when you went back to your own life,
and bathed daily and ate what you wanted to, instead of
what you could get. No one minded night-rides across
the veldt with that end in view, and I have slept very
comfortably under the stars, with my saddle for a pillow,
dreamily wondering if the lion in the distance was making
that noise because he was hungry or because he had
had too much to eat. Once in Nairobi, you bought a silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
shirt, and could display the trousers with the crease in
them and the socks that mother sent you. You wallowed
in your bath, and walked down Government Road pretending
that you had never shovelled damp earth out of
a trench or groomed an accumulation of sticky African
mud off a truculent mule. In the afternoon you sat in
the fashionable tearoom and ate cakes and sweets and
ices, and in the evening there was a dance, and you met
the dearest girl. It was all like heaven!</p>

<p>When we really <i>did</i> start&mdash;I was with the mounted
column that came down from Longido, to sweep round
and threaten the German rear&mdash;the people I was sorry
for were the transport drivers. The rains broke soon
after the advance began, and swamped us out at Kahe,
where we had a three days' scrap in thick brush. What
with weather and scrapping, and mud and broken bridges,
we had a hard enough time ourselves&mdash;we had dropped
the "country gentleman" part of it&mdash;but the wonder is
that the transport ever got through at all. We used to
curse at it sometimes. When you have been under fire
all night and scrapping all day, when you have lost your
pipe in the river and the cigarettes have run out, when
you are very dirty and very hungry, and word is passed
down that no one knows where the food-wagons are&mdash;that
is the sort of happening that is calculated to make
your spirits rise with a bound. Then they come along,
like bearded and very dirty angels, dumping supplies of
bully beef and potatoes, bread and jam, and dates and
coffee, and all is forgiven.</p>

<p>It isn't always fun being a soldier in East Africa, but
I think the transport driver who "gets there" every time
deserves a Military Cross at the least.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORIES OF HEROIC WOMEN IN
THE GREAT WAR</h2></div>

<p><i>Tales of Feminine Deeds of Daring</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thousands of stories from the battlefields tell of the heroism
of the women of France, Russia, England, Italy&mdash;and all the
countries involved in the war&mdash;women fighting as soldiers in
every army; women who act as spies; women who risk their
lives on dangerous missions. A few of these stories are told in
these pages. The first three are from the <i>New York World</i>,
and the fourth from the <i>New York American</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF FRENCH WOMAN WHO DARED
TO FIGHT IN A TANK</p>

<p>If Mlle. Gouraud were not the niece of Gen. Gouraud,
whose right arm was blown off by a bursting Turkish
shell at the Dardanelles, and who was in command of
the contingent of Russian troops fighting in France, and
who succeeded Gen. Lyautey as Military Governor of
Moroccco, she probably would never have had a chance
to suffer from "tank sickness." And it's because she
came so close to proving her point&mdash;that men and women
are equal in war work as well as peace pursuits&mdash;that
Mlle. Gouraud is discouraged. For to-day she is engaged
in the&mdash;for her&mdash;exceedingly tame occupation of driving
a motor ambulance between the railroad stations and
the various hospitals in Paris.</p>

<p>Mlle. Gouraud has always believed in equal rights for
women. When she was sixteen years old and first interested
herself in suffrage she was hooted and laughed at.
Her first speech was delivered in the Place de la Concorde,
in Paris, near the Seine. The crowd deserted her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
for the river bank to watch some boys' swimming races.</p>

<p>"I'll show them," said Mlle. Gouraud, and forthwith
began swimming.</p>

<p>Eighteen months later she was the champion woman
swimmer of France, and defeated many Belgian, Italian
and German swimmers. Once interested in sports she
speedily branched out and became a proficient amateur
boxer. She put on the gloves with Frank Moran and
Willie Lewis and Eugene Mattrot, and even Georges
Carpentier, in exhibition bouts. Then motorcycling became
popular, and after she learned the ways and habits
of a gas engine she learned to fly and was brevetted.</p>

<p>The day all France was plastered with mobilization
order notices Mlle. Gouraud gave up sports. She offered
herself for the army, but even the influence of her uncle,
Gen. Gouraud, was not enough to win her entree direct
into active service. Instead she obtained the post of
ambulance driver for a certain unit of aviators. But she
was never satisfied with that and finally obtained permission
to fly at the front but in a biplane machine, with a
Frenchman as mitrailleuse operator.</p>

<p>And there came the rub. Machine gunners clamored
for chances to go up with the men pilots, but all hung
back at going up with Mlle. Gouraud. It was unlucky,
they said, and beside they didn't want to be in on the
deal if she persisted in risking her life when there were
plenty of men for the job. Just as sailors of old were
superstitious about women on board ship, so were the
observers and machine gunners superstitious about having
a woman in their airplane. And they tried to prove
their point by citing the fact that in the burned wreckage
of the first Zeppelin brought down inside the French lines
were the feet of an incinerated body clad in filmy silk
stockings and tiny black satin slippers.</p>

<p>But Mlle. Gouraud stuck to aviation, hoping eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to persuade some machine gunner to be her team
mate and at the same time trying to find another girl
who would enter the service with her, until the French
Army created its "tank" corps. Then she lost no time in
setting to work for a transfer to that arm of the service.</p>

<p>The order for "V. Gouraud" to join the "tanks" was
finally put through and she went off to their base, behind
the Champagne front, between Soissons and Rheims,
thankful at last that she had won a berth in the newest
and most dangerous and most exciting and the least understood
and most interesting department of the army.</p>

<p>That was only a couple of weeks before Gen. Nivelle's
great offensive was unleashed in the middle of April. It
was just about the time that Lieut. Charles G. Sweeny
of San Francisco and West Point, the only commissioned
American in the French infantry, gave up his post in
charge of a squadron of "tanks" to return to the United
States and offer his services to the United States Army.</p>

<p>The first week of Mlle. Gouraud's training was easy
and delightful to her. Inside the steel walls of the mobile
fortress she learned to swing the little three-pounders
and to operate the cartridge belts of the machine guns
that bristled from all sides of the armored car. She
learned how to sight through the periscopes projecting
from the roof and sides to see the way and the enemy,
and all the other routine work of the "tank's" crew.</p>

<p>But the second week, when she began her training in a
"tank," spelled her undoing. The walls and the roof of
the "tank" are covered with leather upholstery, and every
projecting bit of mechanism and artillery in the little
chamber was also cushioned with leather, because as the
great steel fort plunged forward across shell craters and
over trenches and up and down great piles of debris&mdash;which
had once been French villages&mdash;the occupants
were tossed about inside like ashes in a sifter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>But cuts and bruises and knocks and falls didn't weaken
Mlle. Gouraud's determination to stay with the "tank"
for the great offensive soon to be begun when the engines
of destruction were to receive their baptism of fire under
the tricolor. So she rigged up a sort of harness, with a
line attached to a ring in the roof of the "tank" and with
a belt around her waist. This left her swaying like a
pendulum when the "tank" was moving but kept her
from bumping against the walls, and, what was more
important, from stumbling against other members of the
crew and interfering in the pursuit of their duties.</p>

<p>Then the blow descended. Mlle. Gouraud fell ill of
"tank sickness." Worse than seasickness, worse than
any form of sickness which comes as result of riding in
airplane, or on camel, or by any form of transportation
ever invented, "tank sickness" rendered her absolutely incapable
of remaining with the movable forts. So she was
drafted out, sent to hospital as "malade" and in a few
days when she was discharged, was shunted back to
Paris as "reforme."</p>

<p>Just one fact consoles Mlle. Gouraud to a certain extent.
And that is that she is not the only victim of "tank
sickness."</p>

<p>"I stuck it out three days longer than any of the rest
of the crew who were subject to it," she says.</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF WOMAN WHO PASSED
THROUGH LINES DISGUISED AS
BELGIAN PEASANT</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The thrilling adventures of Mme. Simone Puget, noted Frenchwoman,
who, under disguises as a Belgian peasant and British
"Tommy," undertook reaching her husband in the trenches at the
grave risk of losing both their lives. While they were still together
his regiment was despatched to the dreaded "first line"
and ten days later she was notified of his death under fire.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>There arrived in New York from Europe a young
Frenchwoman, Mme. Simone A. Puget, dressed in deep
mourning. Watching her as she stepped ashore, a
stranger scarcely could picture her as she actually was,
not many months ago, wearing the uniform of an English
soldier and risking her life in that vague, blood-soaked
and shattered inferno of trenches, craters and
barbed-wire called "somewhere in France," to reach her
husband before he died.</p>

<p>Even before that Mme. Puget had achieved fame as the
daring Frenchwoman who accompanied her husband,
M. Andre Puget, the playwright and novelist, through
the Orient disguised as his brother, and as the brilliant
tennis player who captured the woman's championship
for her country four years ago. Mme. Puget also is the
author of "Les Etrangères," and other novels.</p>

<p>"There is so little to tell," she said quietly ... as she
folded her hands on her simple black dress. "We were
in Paris when war was declared and my husband was
called to the front.</p>

<p>"I volunteered as an ambulance driver and worked
almost day and night for four months carrying wounded
from a field hospital to the big emergency hospitals in
Paris.</p>

<p>"Then I heard that Andre had been wounded and
sent to Moulins. I went to him immediately and stayed
to nurse him until he was able to rejoin his regiment.</p>

<p>"After my return to Paris I received another message,
this time from a little village close to the Belgian frontier,
but across the border in Belgium. It did not say in so
many words that Andre had been wounded again, but
merely gave me the impression that he wanted to see me
once more and that I was to try to reach him.</p>

<p>"I quickly realized the difficulties and dangers of such
a journey. Only a short time before the military authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
had made it a law that any soldier whose wife was
found in forbidden territory would be shot. But Andre
and I had been through many dangers together and he
knew that he could trust me. I prepared to start at once.
Armed with my letter, which simply asked me to come
without delay to the bedside of my dying grandfather,
I left Paris for Belgium attired as a Belgian peasant
girl.</p>

<p>"Outside Paris I was stopped. The military guards
absolutely refused to let me proceed.</p>

<p>"'We see too many letters like yours,' was the only
explanation offered.</p>

<p>"In vain did I plead and weep. Then when I had
almost given up in despair, I spied an English officer
whom Andre and I had met in India. I told him who I
was and he recalled me at once, despite my peasant garb.
I asked him to help me to reach my husband. He said
it was impossible.</p>

<p>"But I was desperate and when I wept and quietly
implored his aid, he said he would help me if he could.
That was the last time I saw him, but after my return
to the little hotel where I had spent the night I received
a parcel containing a soldier's uniform together with some
instructions.</p>

<p>"I always felt very much at home dressed as a man,
for I travelled all through Persia and other parts of the
Orient as my husband's brother.</p>

<p>"An artillery train with much baggage was about to
move forward and I could go with that provided I didn't
object to riding in a forage wagon for six hours. My
peasant costume I was to take with me wrapped in a
bundle. Once through the rear lines in Belgian territory
I was to look out for myself.</p>

<p>"We started. I rode for hours and hours, expecting
at every halt to be detected and questioned. But fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
smiled on me and that night after we were well across
the border of Belgium I slipped down and walked forward
unchallenged. The place fairly swarmed with
soldiers, Belgian, French and British. Near a farm
house I changed back to my simple Belgian peasant garb
and prepared to resume my journey on foot as soon as it
became daylight.</p>

<p>"Fortunately I had not many miles to reach the farm
to which the letter had directed me. Walking all day I
reached the farm that night and there I learned to my
great joy that my husband was safe. He had not been
wounded, but his regiment was under orders to leave
within a day or so for another part of the front where
severe fighting was expected and he wanted to see me
once more, if possible, before he left. I saw him next
day. He came to the farm. Then on the morrow he
marched away with his regiment toward Arras, and ten
days later he was killed."</p>

<p>Mme. Andre found that it was easier to get out of the
war zone than into it and she had little difficulty in returning
to Paris. There she began to raise funds for
Red Cross work and to gather material for future reference
about the men-of-letters of America, France and
England who have given up their lives in the great war.</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF MAID OF LOOS WHO WON
THE CROSS OF WAR</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We in America find it possible to read with calm pulse and an
attitude of cold, reasoned impartiality the stories that are written
in red blood and heroic action by real participants in the
great war. Their language, like their viewpoint, seems to us
extreme, violent, embittered. Yet, inasmuch as the presence of
stern reality, which colors viewpoint and language, is the same
that inspired the valorous action itself, we submit, exactly as
it came from Paris, this article, which recounts at first hand the
desperate courage of Mlle. Moreau.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>In the musty archives of the French Government she
is merely Emilienne Moreau, youngest of her sex to have
achieved mention in Gen. Joffre's Order of the Day and
the right to wear upon her breast the Cross of War. But
to thousands upon thousands of French and British soldiers,
she is the Jeanne d'Arc of Loos&mdash;whose valiant
spirit won back Loos for France.</p>

<p>The Official Journal has only this to say about Emilienne
Moreau:</p>

<p>"On Sept. 25, 1915, when British troops entered the
village of Loos, she organized a first-aid station in her
house and worked day and night to bring in the wounded,
to whom she gave all assistance, while refusing to accept
any reward. Armed with a revolver she went out and
succeeded in overcoming two German soldiers who,
hidden in a nearby house, were firing at the first-aid
station."</p>

<p>No mention is made in the official record of the fact
that she shot down the two Germans when their bayonets
were within a few inches of her body; and that later on
she destroyed, with hand bombs snatched from a British
grenadier's stock, three more foemen engaged in the
same despicable work.</p>

<p>Nor is it set forth how, when the British line was
wavering under the most terrible cyclone of shells ever
let loose upon earth, Emilienne Moreau sprang forward
with a bit of tri-colored bunting in her hand and the
glorious words of the "Marseillaise" upon her lips, and
by her fearless example averted a retreat that might
have meant disaster along the whole front. Only the
men who were in that fight can fully understand why
Sir Douglas Haig was right in christening Emilienne
Moreau the Joan of Arc of Loos.</p>

<p>All this happened during the last great offensive of the
allies in Artois, between Arras and La Bassee. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
almost a year before Emilienne Moreau, who is now just
seventeen, had lived in Loos under the rule of the invader.
During almost all of that time the village had been under
the allies' artillery fire. Yet neither she nor her parents
made any attempt to move to a safer place.</p>

<p>Their home was in Loos, and some day, they felt sure,
the Germans would be driven back. They were always
short of food. Sometimes they faced death by starvation,
as well as by bombardment.</p>

<p>But they remained, and Emilienne even contrived to
continue the studies by which she hoped to become a
school teacher.</p>

<p>Like the historic Maid of Orleans, the maid of Loos
has not only the warlike but the diplomatic genius. Despite
the dangers she faced because she was both young
and comely, she succeeded in gaining the Germans' confidence
to such an extent they entrusted to her much of
the administration of what remained of the village.</p>

<p>Children whose parents had been killed or taken away
as prisoners were put in her care, and she was permitted
to give them what little schooling was possible under the
conditions. She was at the same time the guardian angel
of her entire family; for her father, a hot-blooded old
veteran of 1870, frequently put them in danger of drastic
punishment by his furious denunciations of the enemy.</p>

<p>His chagrin so embittered him that, what with that and
scanty nourishment, he died. Then Emilienne became
the protectress and sole support of her mother and her
ten-year-old brother.</p>

<p>She buried her father with her own hands, in a coffin
built by her brother and herself, there being neither
undertakers nor carpenters left in Loos. And she continued
to go quietly about her many tasks, still stifling
within her the resentment against the ever-present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
"Boche," until there came that glorious day when she
knew the allies' offensive had begun.</p>

<p>For three days the girl huddled in the cellar with her
terror-stricken mother and little brother waiting for the
end of that awful cannonade which she realized was destined
to bring the British to Loos.</p>

<p>Every minute of those seventy-two hours she and
every one of the handful of old men, women and children
in the village were facing death, but she told an English
officer after it was all over that to her it had been the
happiest time since the German occupation began.</p>

<p>As soon as Emilienne heard among the deep notes of
the guns the sharp reports of rifles she rushed out into
the street and into the midst of the first phase of the
battle. The British were driving the Germans before
them at the point of the bayonet, but there was still much
desperate activity going forward with bombs and hand
grenades, for remnants of the German main line were
ensconced strongly in various fortlets and bombproofs
scattered among the trenches. On every street of Loos
the wounded lay thickly.</p>

<p>Emilienne saw there was only one way she could help
them, and so very swiftly she turned the Moreau house
into a miniature hospital, and with the aid of the British
Red Cross men she tended as many wounded as she
could drag from the maelstrom of the fight.</p>

<p>It was when the first lull came that she detected the
firing upon her first-aid station. How she followed and
shot down the two Germans responsible for this wanton
attack is narrated in the official report. Not long afterward
she located three more in the act of perpetrating
the same outrage, and this trio she despatched with
grenades borrowed from a British sergeant.</p>

<p>Although it was the first time in the war that a woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
had fought with hand bombs, such was the confusion of
the battle that her brave exploit passed unremarked until
it was revealed by a special correspondent of a Paris
newspaper, the <i>Petit Parisien</i>, who got the story from
British soldiers. From the same source all France
learned that because a young girl had been courageous
enough to sing the "Marseillaise" amidst the din of battle
the British troops had ceased to falter in their advance,
and the village of Loos had again become part of France.</p>

<p>The spirit of Jeanne d'Arc, which inspired Mlle. Emilienne,
is abroad, not only in her native France, but among
the women of France's allies as well. Their heroines
emerge in the war news day by day&mdash;sometimes individually,
sometimes en masse.</p>

<p>There is an actual "Regiment de Jeanne"&mdash;a whole
corps of French and Belgian women commanded by
Mme. Louise Arnaud, who has obtained permission from
the War Minister to put them in uniform. The corps is
for general service at the front, one-third of the members
to be enrolled as combatants, drilled and armed like ordinary
soldiers, and all able to ride and swim.</p>

<p>Mme. Arnaud is the widow of an officer who was killed
in the war. Her father was a merchant ship captain of
Calais. Her new "amazon" command is to be officially
designated the "Volunteer Corps of French and Belgian
Women for National Defence."</p>

<p>Servian and Russian women are fighting alongside the
men in the trenches along the Balkan and other fronts
to-day. Mme. Alexandra Koudasheva, a distinguished
Russian literary lady and musician, has been appointed
Colonel of the Sixth Ural Cossack Regiment of the
Czar's army, for her valiant services in the field.</p>

<p>England has the London Women's Volunteer Reserve,
headed by Col. Viscountess Castlereagh, which drills
regularly at Knightsbridge Barracks and has reached a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
high state of efficiency, both in manoeuvers and the
manual of arms.</p>

<p>Many of the English women soldiers are assisting the
authorities as guards of railway bridges and other points
of military importance in out of the way parts of the
country.</p>

<p>The British Government shows no disposition to make
use of the women in fighting, but many of the women
themselves are eager to fight. The "suffragettes" have
made themselves remarkable by demanding a more vigorous
prosecution of the war.</p>

<p>The reports generally agree that the women fight with
great bravery and some even say that they display greater
bloodthirstiness than men. This is an interesting question
which has hardly yet been settled, although psychologists
have furnished an explanation why we should expect
them to be more ferocious. They are of course more
emotional and when circumstances such as an attack on
their homes or children force them to overcome their
womanly instincts and resort to fighting, they throw away
all restraint and fight with mad, instinctive ferocity.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF RUSSIAN PRIMA DONNA WHO
SAVED VIOLINIST</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A terrible tragedy, this cruel war that is tearing and searing
Europe, but joy is sometimes an offspring of sorrow. In this
instance one wonders if anything less strange and stern than
an international earthquake would have delivered the beautiful
Nadina Legat into the arms of Enrico Arensen. True, Arensen
is a great singer and a distinguished musician, but he is a
plebeian, whereas Mlle. Legat (her stage name), also a brilliant
artist, is a member of a noble Russian family, the favorite
daughter of General Schuvatoff, who is at present leading an
army on the Roumanian frontier. Russian aristocrats, even if
they have so far descended from their pedestals as to sing for
the public, do not lightly relinquish their hereditary traditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
or if they listen to the pleadings of a lowly lover, a haughty
parent intervenes and nips the tender affair in the bud. In this
instance, however, it was Mars, and not Cupid, who broke the
bars.</p></blockquote>

<p>When you sit through a performance of grand opera&mdash;almost
any one of those combinations of drama and
music which retain their hold upon the public&mdash;you cannot
fail to be impressed by the tragic misfortunes which
pursue the hero and heroine. The wise composers of
grand opera see to it that the principal tenor and the
prima donna have troubles calculated to call forth their
highest powers of vocal expression. To find these
strange and inspiring situations they have searched the
dramatic writings of the master-poets of all nations and
periods.</p>

<p>Real life, however, occasionally moves a living hero
and a living heroine in ways which the master-poets of
grand opera could not foresee. By a strange coincidence
that has happened to a principal tenor and a prima donna
who are impersonating together before grand opera audiences
classic heroes and heroines whose history and troubles
were much less thrilling than their own.</p>

<p>Its coloratura soprano, formerly of the Russian Imperial
Opera, is Mme. Nadina Legat, the much beset Gilda
in "Rigoletto"&mdash;drawn from Victor Hugo's "Le Roi
S'Amuse"; the heroine of "La Traviata," otherwise the
consumptive Magdalene, Camille, created by the younger
Dumas; the tragically unfortunate Lucia, for whom
Donizetti went to Walter Scott's "Bride of Lammermoor."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The beginning of the story is essential because of its
bearing on the "big situation." Legat and Arensen enjoyed
their first great opera triumph together at the famous
La Scala, in Milan, she was Gilda and he the
Duke in "Rigoletto." Though both are of Russian birth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
this was their first meeting. As La Scala is recognized
throughout Europe as the final "acid test" of an opera
singer's qualities, the status which both had attained
separately in their own country was of comparatively
small consequence. With nerves tense to the breaking
point, each concentrated on the task of winning that
cultivated, critical Milan audience.</p>

<p>At rehearsals their quarrels were rather fiercer than
is usual between the principal tenor and the prima donna.</p>

<p>"At that time I could hardly endure him," says Mme.
Legat. "We quarrelled terribly. He seemed so unreasonably
insistent on certain details at the rehearsals that
I considered him unbearable, insupportable."</p>

<p>But Mme. Legat confesses that this feeling did not survive
the triumph which they won together. Shortly afterward,
when he departed to fill an engagement with the
Imperial Opera in Berlin and she was summoned back to
Russia, they parted as friends. If they had developed
a stronger feeling for each other, neither was aware
of it.</p>

<p>They went about their separate opera affairs. The
beginning of the European war found Arensen still an
opera favorite in Berlin and Vienna. Mme. Legat was
spending the Summer at Nice, after two years of distinguished
success in Russia, upon which the Czar himself
placed the imperial stamp. She wished to return at
once to Petrograd, but hearing from her mother that the
latter would come to her, she remained at Nice until the
Russian Hospital at Monte Carlo was founded, when
both became nurses there.</p>

<p>And, month after month, while the celebrated opera
soprano was nursing wounded soldiers, not knowing nor
caring about anything else, Arensen, the tenor with whom
she had quarrelled so fiercely on the stage of La Scala,
was virtually a prisoner of war in Germany. For ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
days after the beginning of hostilities he continued his
successful appearances in Berlin&mdash;and then, without
warning, the blow fell.</p>

<p>Some said that rival singers, native Germans, directed
suspicion against him, as though inquiring:</p>

<p>"Russia is our enemy. What is this Russian doing
here?"</p>

<p>One night German soldiers arrested him at the opera
house and he was interned as an enemy alien. He appealed
to the Government for release, pointing out that
he was above the fighting age&mdash;as he then was, which
was before the Russian army age limit was raised&mdash;and
Germany would lose nothing by letting him go home.
The suggestion fell upon deaf ears. His subsequent
efforts to obtain his release the tenor himself relates:</p>

<p>"I was a prisoner for twenty-four hours in the Hausvogter
Gefangniss, which is the delightful name the Berlinese
give to the institution where they intern aliens.
I sent a letter to the Kaiser himself, before whom I have
many times sung, asking my release.</p>

<p>"It was not long before I received an answer to the
letter, granting my request&mdash;a communication from the
Kaiser. Of course, there were conditions. I was to go
to America as soon as it was practicable for me to do so,
anyhow, but that was not sufficient guarantee for the
meticulous German war office.</p>

<p>"No, indeed. It was really a very solemn procedure.
I had to sign an oath in German and Russian that I
would never take up arms in any way against Germany
or her allies. My word, once given, was sufficient. The
German military commander in charge of the prison
camp gave me my freedom, and I received a passport
that permitted me to leave the country. On my last night
in Germany some German officers opened champagne in
my honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"I went through Switzerland to Italy, where I remained
for some time&mdash;in fact, during the greater part of the
long conflict that finally broke down the barriers of neutrality
and led to Italy's enlistment in the war against
her former allies. Eventually I crossed the Piedmont to
the border town of Mentone, where I contemplated entering
France.</p>

<p>"Alas! Here misfortune began anew. I had barely
entered the town when I was halted by a French frontier
guard. From that time on I was treated pretty harshly.</p>

<p>"The French Government put me under strict surveillance.
I was forced to report twice a day at the town
police headquarters, and was really under suspicion at all
times. The reason was, of course, that my associations
with so many Berlin people were known&mdash;the French
were aware that I had remained in the German capital
after war broke out, and did not purpose to take any
chances with me.</p>

<p>"I appealed to the Russian Ambassador in Paris for
help, but was turned down pretty coldly. 'I can't do anything
for you,' was the gist of his reply to my request,
'because I know that you have a lot of German friends.'</p>

<p>"The outlook was, then, that I should have to remain
practically a prisoner until the war was over. It was a
pretty black future. At almost any time, something might
happen, I suppose, that would give the French reason to
think that they had been too lenient in merely keeping
me under surveillance. I might have been interned and
placed in a real prison camp.</p>

<p>"But Providence intervened. One day last Spring,
just after the first Russian troops had come to France,
I met a Russian soldier while he was off duty and had
the opportunity I longed for to talk with someone who
used my native tongue. When he learned my identity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
he was much interested, and he gave me some news that
proved a godsend.</p>

<p>"'You are Arensen, the tenor!' he said. 'How remarkable!
Mme. Legat, of the Imperial Opera at
Petrograd, is only a short distance from this place&mdash;in
the Russian hospital at Monte Carlo!'</p>

<p>"Imagine how the news delighted me! Here, at last,
was a friend on whom I could count. I thanked the
man profusely for the information he had given. Then
I went to my lodgings and wrote an appeal to my country-woman."</p>

<p>The exact wording of that appeal has not been submitted
for publication. Its effect upon Mme. Legat was
electrical. For the first time in nearly two years she became
oblivious to her immediate surroundings&mdash;shattered
and bleeding war heroes and the gruesome accessories
of a military hospital. In all those months she had
hardly thought of the quarrelsome tenor who had shared
her triumph at La Scala. Now, suddenly, he occupied
her whole mental vision&mdash;the central innocent victim of
an impending tragedy.</p>

<p>So intense was that vision that it overwhelmed her
with the vividness of reality. She saw French soldiers
dragging Arensen, her countryman, from his prison cell.
She saw them place him with his back against a wall.
She saw them blindfold him&mdash;and she could hear the
tramp, tramp of the firing squad. Those grim human
instruments of martial law! They turn face to face with
the doomed prisoner&mdash;their musket butts ring upon the
concrete pavement of the prison yard....</p>

<p>Suddenly another figure, that of a woman, rushes upon
the scene and falls upon her knees before the commandant
of the firing squad.</p>

<p>Mme. Legat recognized this figure as herself&mdash;and with
the terrifying vision constantly before her eyes she rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
off to Paris to make her personal appeal to the Russian
Ambassador.</p>

<p>In the quiet, severe, official atmosphere of the Russian
Embassy Mme. Legat calmed herself, collected her wits
and prepared to measure them with those of M. Isowsky,
her country's chief representative at the French capital.
The Russian Ambassador paid to her the homage
due to a celebrated singer&mdash;and then resumed his frigid
official aspect. At her mention of Arensen he froze.</p>

<p>"But, Monsieur Arensen is a fellow Russian&mdash;our
countryman."</p>

<p>"Madame," said the Ambassador, curtly, "I am by no
means positive that Arensen is a loyal Russian. For two
years he has lived in Germany and Austria&mdash;our two
most powerful enemies. He acquired hosts of German
friends. He comes to France plastered over with German
credentials. He bears the Kaiser's own signed permit to
leave Germany. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you believe that I am a loyal Russian?" demanded
Mme. Legat.</p>

<p>The Russian Ambassador smiled graciously. Ah, he
had no doubt of Madame's loyalty.</p>

<p>That awful vision still obsessed her. She realized that
there was nothing she would not do to save Arensen. She
remembered that she was the daughter of a general in the
Imperial Russian army. She drew herself up to her full
height and looked the Russian Ambassador straight in the
eyes. She said:</p>

<p>"I will vouch for M. Arensen. I will guarantee that
he is a loyal Russian, and will remain so."</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;&mdash;," pondered M. Isowsky. "Well, well&mdash;um&mdash;how
can you be sure? How can you assure me?"</p>

<p>Right then and there Mme. Legat felt a sudden emotion,
and knew what she was going to do&mdash;what she
wanted to do&mdash;to dispel that tragic vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll give you the assurance of a wife," she said. "I'll
marry him!"</p>

<p>The Russian Ambassador was baffled&mdash;admitted it.
He signed the papers that gave Arensen his freedom as a
loyal Russian. The heroine herself relates the sequel:</p>

<p>"Like Tosca in the opera, I sped to him bearing freedom.
I didn't have to tell him the whole story&mdash;not then.
We found that our old acquaintance, begun at La Scala,
had blossomed into love during our separation. So he
did the proposing. We were married just an hour before
the <i>Lafayette</i> sailed, bringing us to the United
States."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW WE STOLE THE TUG-BOAT</h2></div>

<p><i>The Story of a Sensational Escape from the
Germans</i></p>

<p><i>Told by Sergeant "Maurice Prost," of the Belgian
Army</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Maurice Prost"&mdash;now a sergeant in the Belgian army, escaped
from Belgium, with a party of over forty men and two women,
in very romantic circumstances. How he and an Alsatian outwitted
the Huns is here narrated in his own words, as recorded
by a correspondent who met him in Paris. For obvious reasons
all the names have been disguised in this tale in the <i>Wide World
Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;"I WAS IN A CAFE IN LIEGE"</p>

<p>The outset of the whole affair dates from one intensely
cold day in the middle of December, 1916. I had slipped
into an obscure <i>café</i> in a small street in Liége as much
in search of tranquility of mind as with the object of
getting a comforting glass of hot coffee. With thousands
of other Liégois I was trembling under the reign of terror
caused by the daily slave-raids, which, ever since
their inception a fortnight before by order of that arch-criminal,
the Kaiser, had raised a mighty cry of anguish
from the stricken city.</p>

<p>It was with a sigh of relief that I found the place was
empty. Taking a seat at one of the little marble-topped
tables, as near to the meagrely-heated circular stove as I
could get, I prepared to snatch a brief spell of quietness
from that day of sudden alarms and haunting fears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>But I had no sooner taken my first comforting gulp
of the steaming hot liquid, served by a careworn woman
in widow's weeds, than an incident occurred which sent
a cold thrill to my heart. The <i>café</i> door opened, and in
walked a German soldier, dressed as a <i>feldwebel</i>. After
taking in the interior with a quick glance he clanked
straight up to the stove, rubbed his hands vigorously, and,
calling for a "<i>Café bien chaud</i>," in excellent French, sat
down opposite to me with a formal "<i>Bonjour!</i>"</p>

<p>I responded to his greeting with all the indifference I
could summon up, but, eyeing him suspiciously, my inner
self uttered the word "<i>Pincé</i>." There could be no doubt
about it; I had "got dropped on" at last. Immediately
my mind became once more engrossed with thoughts of
the loathsome beast I had pictured the Huns to be&mdash;a
huge octopus, faced by defeat and death, which had begun
to suck the last drop of blood out of my unfortunate
country by sending tens of thousands of men, women,
and children into captivity. Now, at last, one of its tentacles
had writhed my way and was about to seize me up!
My heart was filled with a fierce hatred of the <i>feldwebel</i>
sitting opposite me. A cynical smile seemed to lurk in
his eyes&mdash;that look of inexorable cruelty which I had
seen so often on the faces of the Huns as they went from
house to house, dragging sons and daughters from the
arms of their aged parents and driving them off into
exile with the butt-ends of their rifles. These daily and
nightly scenes, terrifying though they were had fascinated
me. Should I make a clean breast of it and drag
the mask from the rascal's smiling face, or spring at his
throat and shake the life out of him?</p>

<p>Whilst I was in the midst of these conflicting thoughts
the <i>feldwebel</i> drew forth a packet of cigarettes and, having
pulled one half out held it towards me with a well-assumed
air of good fellowship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have a smoke?" he said. "It's a jolly cold day, <i>mon
ami</i>. One's glad to be indoors to-day&mdash;even in a badly-warmed
place like this. Mine's a particularly icy job, I
can tell you."</p>

<p>I accepted his cigarette with the feelings of a condemned
man who has been granted his last smoke....
"<i>Merci!</i>" I muttered. Then, becoming suddenly
bolder, I added, not without a touch of scorn: "Yes;
your job <i>must</i> be particularly cold these nights, going
from house to house between twelve and one in the morning.
How many did you rake in yesterday?"</p>

<p>"House to house? How many did I rake in?" repeated
the <i>feldwebel</i>, reflectively, as he lit his cigarette. His
smile quickly developed into a laugh, which would have
exasperated me beyond measure had he not hastened to
add: "Ah! I see. <i>Eh bien</i>, my friend, you're quite on
the wrong track. My job is on the water, thank goodness.
I've nothing to do with the raids. I've not sunk
so low as that yet&mdash;and I don't intend to, either. You're
a Belgian, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, still somewhat defiantly. "And you're
a German, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"<i>Malgré moi</i>&mdash;in spite of myself. As the saying goes:
'The cowl does not make the monk.' I'm an Alsatian&mdash;Baldens
by name."</p>

<p>The man was frankness itself. His open manner and
the declaration of his nationality disarmed me at once.
Whatever my first suspicions may have been, there was
no gainsaying the sincerity of his attitude, the cordiality
of that phrase, "<i>mon ami</i>," with which he interlarded
his confidences, for we had not been in conversation more
than ten minutes before both he and I dropped into the
confidential tone of old acquaintances.</p>

<p>"Quite an excusable mistake on your part, when one
comes to think of it," continued Baldens. "Well, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
was going to tell you, I'm on the water&mdash;that is to say,
on the tug-boat <i>Anna</i>, stationed on the canal leading into
the Meuse at Devant-le-Pont-lez-Visé. Ugh! it's cold
work when the wind's blowing from the north or east!
There are four of us on board, including the captain, and
we've been in charge of the <i>Anna</i> ever since she was
seized by the German Government. They're an uncongenial
lot, and the captain's the worst of the three. If I
were to tell you how deep my love is for France you'd
be able to realize, <i>mon ami</i>, what my feelings are when
I'm with those three Boches on a dark night on board
the <i>Anna</i>. Many times, when on guard, I've thought of
parting company with them. But that's easier said than
done."</p>

<p>Baldens, the patriotic Alsatian, obliged to serve as a
non-commissioned officer in the German army, proceeded
to enlarge on his devotion to <i>la belle France</i> and, growing
still more confidential, told me of his dreams of attempted
escape from Belgium. To make a long story short, he and
I finally put our heads together, and, over many hot coffees
and innumerable cigarettes, hit on a plan by means
of which we hoped to gain our liberty and assist a number
of others to gain theirs. How we managed it I will
now explain.</p>


<p>II&mdash;THE KIDNAPPED CREW ON THE "ANNA"</p>

<p>Three days after this fortuitous meeting, Baldens and
I met at Devant-le-Pont-lez-Visé, not far from Liége, in
order to study the disposition of the land and water. At
a short distance from the <i>Anna</i>&mdash;one of those massive,
coal-black tug-boats so familiar to the inhabitants of the
banks of our Belgian canals and rivers&mdash;was a public-house
frequented by boatmen; and near to it we found an
equally convenient private house, which, as it was to let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
furnished, we took on a monthly tenancy. You will comprehend
the reason for this when I add that, having made
these preliminary preparations, I returned to Liége and
began getting together a party of citizens who, in hourly
dread of deportation, were anxious to join in any well-thought-out
scheme of escape. Presuming that we succeeded
in getting possession of the <i>Anna</i> and navigating
her out of the canal into the Meuse, and thence to Dutch
waters (for that was the ambitious plan we had in view),
we had to have some place where we could temporarily
harbour our fellow-adventurers before they went on
board. I had no difficulty, I can assure you, in finding
volunteers. No fewer than sixty people expressed their
willingness to join us, and did, in fact, assemble at the
house in question on the night fixed for carrying out our
plans. True, eighteen of these got frightened at the last
moment and returned home, on the plea that the risk was
too great, as the boat would have to run the gauntlet past
German sentries. Over forty, however, including two
brave women, remained staunch and stuck to us.</p>

<p>It was a pitch-black night just five days before Christmas
when Baldens and I got our little party of fugitives
under that convenient roof and started active operations
by sauntering in the direction of the <i>Anna</i>, with the object
of inviting the captain and crew to have a glass at
the neighbouring "pub." The three topers took the hook,
daintly baited by Baldens, in splendid fashion, and&mdash;one
bottle leading to another&mdash;we kept them at it until turning-out
time. But it takes a lot of liquor to fuddle a
Boche completely, and, though we arranged to mix their
drinks pretty often and let them have the lion's share, they
were still in possession of their senses when they started
back for their cabins on the <i>Anna</i>. However, the far-seeing,
ingenious Baldens was with them, and I knew he
could be trusted to finish the job, especially when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
whispered to me, after wishing me a boisterous good
night in which the others joined:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Everything will be ready, Prost, in an hour's time.
You can all of you come aboard then and assist in the
finishing touches. <i>Au revoir!</i>"</p>

<p>Back with my flock in the furnished house, where I
found them waiting in great anxiety, I explained how
things were going, and an hour later (how the time did
hang on our hands!) we all sallied forth. I led the party
in single file through the darkness, and it was an immense
relief to me on reaching the <i>Anna</i> to find that Baldens
was waiting for us&mdash;a clear proof he had succeeded in his
object and that the coast was clear.</p>

<p>When we got below we found the captain and his two
men stretched out on the floor, dead drunk, and chloroformed
into the bargain.</p>

<p>"Now, quick's the word and sharp's the motion," said
Baldens. "Off with their uniforms. And who'll volunteer
to put them on? Prost, find three men who are about
the same size as these fellows&mdash;three cool-headed men
who don't mind facing danger."</p>

<p>It was not at all an easy task undressing and redressing
those three helpless lumps of Boche humanity, but we
managed it all right, in the dim light from a hanging lantern,
and in a little over half an hour three Liégois, armed
with Mausers, were impersonating the German guards
on the deck of the <i>Anna</i>.</p>

<p>We were to be off on our voyage as soon as possible.
Steam was to be got up without delay, so several of us,
with the assistance of Baldens, who, of course, knew the
tug-boat from end to end, set to work to do our best to
light the furnaces. Whilst we were in the midst of this
work, which required to be done with the greatest caution,
in order not to arouse the suspicions of the German patrol,
whose measured footsteps could be heard along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
towpath every half-hour, a tremendous uproar arose in
the cabin where we had left the three prostrate Germans.
Baldens and I rushed in, with drawn revolvers, and were
just in time to prevent the captain&mdash;who had come to his
senses and taken in the situation at a glance&mdash;from dashing
up on deck and raising the alarm. He was a powerfully-built
man, and it took the two of us to master him.
He fought like a tiger, literally with tooth and nail.
Finally, however, we got him in a corner, and, whilst I
was pinioning him from behind, Baldens kept him covered
with his six-shooter, which he threatened to empty
into his carcass if he moved another muscle. Thereupon
the mastered man caved in and begged for mercy in the
classic phrase: "<i>Kamarades! Kamarades! Nicht kaput!</i>"</p>


<p>III&mdash;"WE BOUND AND GAGGED THE GERMAN
CAPTAIN"</p>

<p>When we had bound and gagged the obstreperous captain
of the <i>Anna</i> we completed our work as stokers, and,
with infinite care, lest we should attract the attention of
the sentinels of a neighbouring lock, began to man&oelig;uvre
the boat along the canal. It was necessary to pass through
this lock in order to reach the channel which leads into the
Meuse. The <i>Anna</i>, with its crew of over forty fugitives,
drew more than two metres of water, so we were confronted
with the problem of the depth of the water in
this channel. Was it sufficiently deep to accommodate us?
Please remember that amongst the members of our improvised
crew there was not a single boatman, not a single
<i>homme du métier</i>. And remember, too, that we knew that
if we were caught in the act we should all of us be ranged
in line against a wall and shot without mercy!</p>

<p>I must confess that at this juncture the situation began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
to look very black indeed; and a certain amount of panic
reigned among our flock. Yet no one asked to be put
ashore. On the contrary, when, after a little plain speaking,
the German pilot and engineer (who had come to
their senses and begged to be released from their bonds)
consented to throw in their lot with ours and go to their
respective posts, willing hands were ready on all sides to
assist in opening the lock and measuring the water in
the channel leading to the Meuse. The depth was found
to be a little over two metres, and the lock was opened
without difficulty.</p>

<p>Slowly and without any untoward incident the <i>Anna</i>
entered the lock. When it was being closed behind her,
however, the gates were worked too rapidly, with the result
that the water was thrown into violent commotion.
The tug began to roll from side to side, as if on an angry
sea, and two of the three boats moored alongside her were
smashed to matchwood against the walls of the lock.
This accident, however, was actually in our favour, since
it prevented the sides of the tug itself from being stove
in and helped to propel her into the free water of the
channel.</p>

<p>There was now a very faint glimmering of daylight,
and the two German sentries stationed on the towpath
approached a little nearer to look on at our strange man&oelig;uvres.
Luckily, however, their curiosity did not lead
them to utter a word of comment or even to make a gesture.
When we got into the channel (known as the Canal
de la Sucrerie) and began the second part of our long
and difficult work&mdash;the steering of the <i>Anna</i> into the river&mdash;these
sentinels were joined by three or four other German
soldiers, attracted by the unusual commotion at that
early hour of the morning. They looked on, evidently
quite amused at our efforts. Fortunately for us, it never
occurred to them to put any questions to the singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
<i>feldgrauen</i> with spiked helmets who were busily handling
boat-hooks and ropes; and thus it was that the good tug-boat
<i>Anna</i>, flying the German flag, slowly floated in safety
into the Meuse, between two Boche sentries with fixed
bayonets.</p>

<p>What a relief it was to find ourselves in the river!
The battle, we thought, was practically over. All we had
got to do was to forge ahead at full speed towards Holland
and liberty. But, as events proved, we were slightly
mistaken in our calculations.</p>

<p>The boilers of the <i>Anna</i> were now heated to fourteen
atmospheres, and away we went at as great a speed as
was prudent in the semi-darkness. After we had proceeded
for several miles, Baldens, who had been making
sure that the captain was in a more reasonable state of
mind, joined me on deck, and, with a grave face, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Prost, we're not out of the wood yet. The captain's
still inclined to foam at the mouth and make trouble,
though I've granted him the favour of ungagging him.
No sooner had I done that than he began to 'strafe' me
and you and everybody, and swore we'd get caught yet,
because of the electric cable which the Boches have
stretched across the Meuse between Lanaye and Eysden.
We must now be getting pretty near the danger zone.
Keep your weather-eye open, Prost, for I'm told there's
a motor-boat there with machine-guns aboard."</p>

<p>And, sure enough, a quarter of an hour later I spotted
this electric cable. Instructions were at once given to the
engineer to put on his utmost speed, and everybody save
the man at the rudder, was ordered off the deck. The
only thing to do was to try to cut through the obstacle.</p>

<p>There was no resisting the heavy weight of the <i>Anna</i>.
She snapped the wire easily, but as it broke, with an immense
flash like summer lightning, one end, unfortunately,
got entangled with our screw and rudder, which broke as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
though it had been made of glass. However, the dreaded
motor-boat did not put in an appearance (I suppose the
men were still fast asleep), and the tug drifted slowly onwards.</p>

<p>The <i>Anna</i> was now completely helpless, and before we
had drifted very far she stuck in the mud&mdash;fortunately
well within Dutch waters. Needless to say we lost no
time in utilizing our third and last boat, and in about an
hour everybody, including the still unruly Boche captain,
whom Baldens disembarked last of all, was ashore. Meanwhile,
the four German sentries in charge of the cable
had awakened and, finding the line broken, had got their
electric searchlights to work and ultimately located us.
It was too late then, however, for them to think of capturing
us. They dare not come on to Dutch territory, nor
was it prudent for them to fire a shot in our direction.
As to their searchlights, they were actually of use to us,
since they lit up, here and there, the still dark and unknown
ground on which, for a time, we wandered, ere
we came to a friendly Dutch dwelling house, where we
inquired our way to the nearest village.</p>

<p>After such an exciting and lucky adventure as this,
Christmas, 1916, was the happiest I ever experienced.
Baldens and I and a number of others who had shared in
our dangers spent the day together. I will leave you to
imagine the heartiness with which we toasted each other
and our mental congratulations on our fortunate meeting
in that Liége <i>café</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE RUSSIAN SUN&mdash;ON THE TRAIL
OF THE COSSACKS</h2></div>

<p><i>"We Are the Don Cossacks&mdash;We Do Not
Surrender!"</i></p>

<p><i>Told by Herr Roda Roda, the Austrian War
Correspondent</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The story was written for the <i>Vienna Neue Freie Presse</i> by
Herr Roda Roda, the most prolific and brilliant of the Austrian
war correspondents. It shows a high literary skill and a fine
simplicity of feeling. Unlike most war correspondents, Herr
Roda Roda can see both sides of the picture. He reproduces
the real experiences of the men who do the fighting, throwing
into relief their true humanity and their lack of hate; and it is
out of such material that the true history of the war on its
human side will have to be constructed. When the time for
that work arrives Herr Roda Roda will be rated as an invaluable
authority. This story, with editorial comment, is translated by
William L. McPherson for the <i>New York Tribune</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;A NIGHT MARCH WITH THE AUSTRIANS</p>

<p>Such a silent advance into gloomy, unknown Russia
has its own beauty. The night is still, hanging like a dark
veil over the land. One sees nothing of the villages which
lie to the right and left; one has no idea of the depth of
the woods which open before him and then close again;
one feels only the sand or the clayey soil under his feet,
and has but one measure for everything&mdash;the passing of
time.</p>

<p>For two days past we have been out of touch with the
enemy. On the whole front our machine guns have
driven him out of his invisible positions. He has vanished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
and only the trenches are there in which he sought
again and again to carry on a rear-guard fight. They
stretch on both sides of the road which we follow. Deep,
black and wavering, the line runs in the dirty gray of the
half-melted snow. And on the tops of the low ridges a
tender, silvery light glimmers. It is the new day which
pierces through the darkness.</p>

<p>Our brigadier trots by with his staff. The tall, big-boned
bay which he has ridden for the last four months
throws in our faces for a second the foam of his flanks.
The old gentleman sits bent forward in the saddle, as if
that forward lurch would help him to see further into
the blackness.</p>

<p>No sound anywhere. An icy breeze from the north-east
blows in light puffs over us and whistles through the bare
branches. Our men move along, silent and patient. Occasionally
one lifts his head and scans the sky. Have
the heavy clouds which have obscured the night broken
at last and will the sun appear? For the sun&mdash;that is
their greatest longing. They have dreamed of it when
the rain beat for hours and hours on the tin of their eating
utensils and they have sighed for it in the dampness
of the cramped trenches.</p>

<p>To-day the sun is coming. With a pale, irridescent
glimmer it announces its imminence on the horizon, gladdening
with its first light hundreds of thousands of hard,
beard-covered countenances.</p>

<p>Presently day breaks. Again around about the marching
column lies the monotonous, melancholy, rolling country
which in the last weeks its feet have trodden and into
which its spades have dug. These are the same windmills
which reach their shattered arms into the air, the same
poor frozen birches on the roadside, and on the right
hand the same black, cloddy woods which we have so
often encountered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly there comes a shot&mdash;a short, slight report.
Not one of our people turns his head. Only one of the
munitions train animals which trot behind the company
in long teams pricks up his ears for a moment.</p>

<p>The captain guides his horse up the left bank of the
road and inspects the train. His square, creased face,
which never smiles, extends to the men an unspoken
morning greeting. Every day the company awaits that
greeting. And evening never comes without the captain
having looked for a second earnestly and curiously into
the eyes of every one of his soldiers. His people know
that and it makes them strong and tough.</p>

<p>Then the regimental adjutant comes on the jump.</p>

<p>"Herr Captain, take over the command of the battalion!
The first battalion will form connection with the tenth
division. Clear the wood and drive the enemy eventually
toward the north-east!"</p>

<p>Our captain nods and salutes. As he rides on he studies
the map and gives his commands simultaneously
wherever he goes.</p>

<p>Four scouting patrols separate themselves from the
column and swarm over the white and brown patches of
open fields to the right. Behind them the companies,
bending low to protect themselves, seek their way.</p>

<p>The captain has dismounted and leads. Again and
again he signals "Down" with his riding stick to the
neighboring detachments and looks through his field
glasses. The other officers also inspect the wood's edge,
which is now outlined sharply in the purple morning
glow.</p>

<p>The patrols become smaller and smaller and vanish
behind the first trees.</p>

<p>A minute of waiting and then we go ahead again.
Almost at the same moment comes a short, sharp crackling
from far ahead of us. The last report sounds like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
a sort of distant singing in the clear air. Then silence
again.</p>

<p>"Forward," our commandant points with the riding
stick. The first company spreads itself out. The others
follow slowly in closer order. The situation is not yet
cleared up. And again we are rooted for a quarter of
an hour to the watery, slippery surface. The wet cold of
the earth eats quickly into our bodies. A few of the
men lie flat on their backs, using their equipment to protect
them from the dampness.</p>


<p>II&mdash;"THE WOOD IS FULL OF COSSACKS"</p>

<p>But the sun is now up. With slender, blood-red fingers
it grips the tops of the fir trees and casts warm, shining
rays over the brown, sun-starved land.</p>

<p>The first news comes back. A lance corporal, with a
medal for bravery on his breast, falls flat on the ground
before the captain.</p>

<p>"I obediently report: Cossacks. The whole wood is
full of Cossacks&mdash;all of them dismounted."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>Our commander breathes freely. Now we know where
we are. We shall soon settle accounts with that pack.</p>

<p>The attack on the wood begins. It is not prepared for
by fire, since it is desirable to lose no time. We must
strike as quickly as possible, keeping in contact with the
neighboring division. And it is marching forward abreast
of ours.</p>

<p>With long, hard strides we approach the black fir trees
at the forest's edge. A sign from the commandant and
the naked bayonets are adjusted to the gun barrels.
Many of them have cast for a moment a reflected ray of
sunlight into the darkened wood.</p>

<p>The soil clings thicker to our shoes and our pace gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
hotter. The faces of the men redden. They know what
that means&mdash;wood fighting. Either victory at the first
dash or a long hand-to-hand struggle&mdash;work for clubbed
muskets and fists. But the wood lies still before us, as
if it is asleep. Only in the tree tops there is a slight
rustling.</p>

<p>Our captain goes on ahead. Now the shadow falls
like a curtain drawn behind him. The first company
after him. The second in echelon. And still not a shot.
My men rush, with necks bent forward, among the first
trees. Their countenances are hard and merciless and
drawn about the nostrils. Here and there a sharp red
spot shows on either cheek.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shot cracks out, and then a volley. And
there&mdash;opposite the first company&mdash;a second, a third volley.</p>

<p>A few soldiers fall groaning against the trees. Here
and there one hears the last shriek of a dying man. We
sink flat on the soft ground and arrange our front. Before
us and both to the right and left of us is the enemy.</p>

<p>But is it the enemy? There some Cossacks shoot
singly or in little groups behind the tree trunks and
stumps. We see a flat, dirty, green cap appear and vanish
again, aimlessly and at random&mdash;now very near us
and now deep in the wood or sidewards in the thicket.</p>

<p>Our captain gives the order: "Both wings bend backward.
Fire at will!" And from our skirmish line comes
the smothered beating of the Mannlichers&mdash;single and
separate at first, then more and more concerted, and
finally becoming one big volume, with a roaring echo,
which envelops the trunks and the tree tops and floats out
behind our back into the open.</p>

<p>The shots of our opponents sing over our heads and
strike sharply into the timber. The enemy is now here,
now there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Our captain lies on the skirmish line. He has taken
the gun of a wounded man and aims long and carefully
before he pulls the trigger. Suddenly he springs up. For
a moment we see his square, wrinkled face, stiff and impassive
as ever; then he swings the rifle butt over his
head and shouts: "Forward!"</p>

<p>The companies are in a narrow, closely concentrated
line behind him. An iron rain greets us.</p>

<p>We dash over the first corpses of the enemy. From the
soft bed of the fir needles long, blood-stained arms stretch
after us&mdash;arms of men with yellowish, distorted faces.</p>

<p>Again we are forced to seek cover on the ground. Too
many of our people have already fallen. And the enemy,
whose front is not yet uncovered, bends around on both
sides of us. We must have regard for the safety of our
rear. Our first skirmish line takes the form of a shallow,
wide-spread curve.</p>


<p>III&mdash;"WE DO NOT SURRENDER!"</p>

<p>On the wings the tumult breaks out anew. The captain
crawls on his stomach along the front. His people must
know that he is with them.</p>

<p>All at once he receives a start. There lies a Russian
officer, among our soldiers. His youthful, handsome face
is as white as the snow on the branches. His eyes roll
and the pale lips try to form a word. The captain bends
over him. A file leader says: "Breast and upper leg."
They bandage the badly wounded man and give him
something to drink.</p>

<p>Our captain wants to go ahead. Then the Russian says
to him softly and in correct German, "Don't shoot!"</p>

<p>The captain pushes his cap back on his neck and lifts
his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"How so? Will you surrender?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>The other tries to smile. His big, fine teeth gleam
white.</p>

<p>"We are Don Cossacks. We do not surrender. But
we have had nothing to eat. It is four days already.
The horses are dead. And the Russians are already far
away."</p>

<p>"How many are you?" asks the commandant.</p>

<p>"We were strong, six sontnias, perhaps. But the
woods, the woods! There we stick day and night. And
fight and fight. Each for himself, each alone, each without
hope."</p>

<p>Our captain presses the wounded man, who seeks to
raise his upper body, softly back on the ground.</p>

<p>And while the wood right and left rings with the echoes
of musketry he kneels hesitatingly beside the Cossack
officer. For the first time something of a soft expression
steals over his impassive countenance. There is a slight
quiver about the curves of his mouth.</p>

<p>"You must surrender," he says, after a pause, curtly
and decisively. "It is an unequal combat."</p>

<p>The Russian shakes his head.</p>

<p>"They will not; we will not. We are Don Cossacks."</p>

<p>"But you must."</p>

<p>The captain springs up and gives the battalion bugler
the order, "Cease firing."</p>

<p>The signal is heard with the greatest difficulty amid the
thousand-voiced tumult. But slowly it gets the upper
hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly the fire ceases along the entire line. Only
in the depths of the wood a few single shots still ring
out.</p>

<p>Again the captain bends over the injured man.</p>

<p>"We will tell them, you and I. You will give the command
to your people. You must give it. And I shall
honor your heroes; for they are heroes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Four men improvise a litter. The Russian is placed
on it. He groans at every step of the bearers and his
eyes wander from one of them to the other. Our captain
goes, head erect, into the darkness of the wood.
Behind him go the two bearers with the officer. We wait
and wait, clinging breathlessly to the ground.</p>

<p>The sun creeps through the branches and spreads its
soft, grateful warmth over us. And of a sudden we are
strangely softened, overcome by the light of the day and
by the gleam of humanity which, as from another world,
for once falls into our hard, hard life.</p>

<p>The minutes pass, slow and noiseless, coming and
going without fighting, without bloodshed, without horror.</p>

<p>As the sun mounts higher and higher, the Cossacks
gradually gather in our neighborhood. They stream toward
us from all directions. The first of them are distrustful
and sullen, the last of them storming and hungry.</p>

<p>We are horrified at the nameless suffering in their
lean, misery-smitten faces. Then we turn our bread
sacks over&mdash;and we shudder at the bestial ravenousness
with which men can eat.</p>

<p>Our captain and the wounded Russian come with the
last group. Both smile a smile such as I have never seen
before.</p>

<p>At midday we get in touch with the neighboring division.
We bring in 540 Don Cossacks, prisoners.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A BOMBING EXPEDITION WITH THE
BRITISH AIR SERVICE</h2></div>

<p><i>Daring Adventures of the Royal Fliers</i></p>

<p><i>Told by First Lieutenant J. Errol D. Boyd, of the
British Air Service</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The feats of the British fliers form a thrilling chapter of modern
heroism. Their exploits are innumerable. In the defense of
London from Zeppelin raids, on the Western and Eastern battle-front,
in the Dardanelles, over the deserts of Africa, and along
the valleys of the Nile&mdash;they are not unlike the crusaders of
old in their heroism. We here present one typical narrative&mdash;it
is the story of a Canadian, from Toronto, who relates his own
thrilling experience to a war correspondent of the <i>New York
World</i> at The Hague. "Boydie," as his friends call him, was
shot down by a German anti-aircraft gun from the almost unbelievable
height of 12,000 feet. Three cylinders were torn away
from his engine. The wings were pierced in five places. His
machine dropped two miles, twisting and turning, looping the
loop ten times on his way down. It finally landed, right-side
up, with the young Canadian safe and sound, just fifty yards
inside of Dutch territory. He sprang from his seat and gave
brisk battle to the soldiers of Queen Wilhelmina. They overpowered
him, and interned him, but not until there'd been a considerable
mix-up, in which fists and noses figured prominently&mdash;Boydie's
fists and some Dutch noses.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;"BOYDIE'S" OWN STORY OF ADVENTURE</p>

<p>It's the greatest game, the greatest thrill in the world!
I used to think that driving a motor car 100 miles an
hour was fun. I was in that game in Canada for a
while. Then I thought that just riding in a slow old
biplane 'bus was a pretty keen proposition. But a chap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
never knows what real sport is until he's driving his own
fast machine, with a pal working a machine gun, and
going after the other fellow hell-bent for election. That's
the life!</p>

<p>It makes me laugh now to think of the old biplane
"pushers"&mdash;with the propellers at the rear&mdash;that I used
to fool with. Old Farnams and Curtises and Wrights.
Why, a chap was lucky to get 65 or 70 miles an hour
out of some of them.</p>

<p>It was the proudest day of my life when they gave me
my flying ticket and a speedy little Nieuport biplane and
said: "Here she is, Boydie. Take her over the Channel.
Beat it for Dunkirk. Some of the others are going
across this afternoon, so you won't get lost if you follow
them. Top o' the luck to you, old Toronto." Half a
dozen other machines went sailing over the water, 5,000
feet high, that spring morning doing a leisurely eighty
miles an hour and spaced as evenly as a squadron of
battleships in parade formation. The leaders were circling
about and descending toward an immense open
space in front of a long row of hangars at Dunkirk.</p>

<p>It wasn't long after that before I got into my first
scrap. I never will forget that, for I made a bally fool
out of myself and was mighty glad to get back alive to
the station. I had a pretty good machine, a Moran monoplane
equipped with a machine gun, and an old chap
called Gott, a sergeant, went up with me and sat in the
gun seat. I was wild to see the German lines.</p>

<p>"Go and take a look at them," the C. O. said, "but
don't cross or you'll probably get jolly well peppered.
Those 'Archies' [anti-aircraft guns] can shoot pretty far
and pretty straight, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>


<p>II&mdash;"WE FIGHT 8,000 FEET IN AIR"</p>

<p>I promised to be careful and up we went. At about
8,000 feet I headed her for the German trenches, and in
a few minutes we were right over them. Old Gott gave
me a nudge then, and right ahead of us, a few miles off,
I saw two German Albatross machines coming right for
us. Old Gott and I had our telephones on and he said:
"What about it, Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"What do you say if we let 'em have a bit?" I asked
him.</p>

<p>"Right-o, sir," said Gott. He was a game chap, that
old fellow, and he'd been in many a scrap. I often wonder
whether he's still all right. Well, he had a belt of
cartridges on the gun, and he got ready to spin 'em out.
I stuck the nose of the old bus up in the air and tried to
get on top of the Germans. My machine was a better
climber than theirs, and so when we passed I was a
couple of hundred feet higher. Old Gott pointed the gun
at 'em and kept working the trigger. I could see the
flames shooting out of the muzzle. But the Boches were
pretty busy too. I caught sight of their gunmen working
away with their quick-firers as we passed. With the
rush of air it was impossible to feel the whiz of any of
their bullets; but I knew jolly well that they were pretty
close to us, and we found later a lot of holes in our
wings.</p>

<p>Well, all of us wheeled, and at it we went again. Gott
put on another belt of cartridges and let 'em have it.
As we passed the second time one of the Albatrosses
dropped a couple of hundred feet. I thought that Gott
had winged the pilot, but it must have been only an
airhole they struck, for they straightened out and
went on.</p>

<p>They're speedy beggars, those Albatrosses. By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
time I got turned again and straightened out they were
half a mile or so off and driving like the devil over their
own country&mdash;running away from us.</p>

<p>"Let's go after them and give 'em what-for, Gott!" I
said. "Very good, sir," he answered. So after them we
went. I gave the old bus all she had, but I couldn't
overtake the Albatrosses, nor even get near enough to
have another shot at them. Mile after mile we drove
until, finally, we came to a town&mdash;Ghent it must have
been&mdash;and I thought it was about time to start back.
We were only about 6,000 feet high.</p>

<p>All of a sudden there was a little white cloud directly
in front of us, a few hundred yards off. We plunged
right through it, and I got a sniff of some strong acid-like
odor. Then little white clouds began to appear at
our sides, and below us and above us. Gott pointed
upward and I made the machine climb as hard as she
could without standing right on our tail.</p>

<p>I realized then that the Albatrosses had purposely run
away from us to lead us into a trap. They had led us
right over a long line of "Archies."</p>

<p>There we were, twenty miles or so from home, with
every anti-aircraft gun the Germans had peppering away
at us. We certainly made a race for it. There was no
use circling around and climbing. The only thing to do
was to go up as best we could while driving, straight
ahead, and trust to luck. To get home was the one thing
we wanted.</p>

<p>It took us perhaps fourteen or fifteen minutes to do
the twenty-odd miles. And in every mile of that distance
there were at least two or three Archies letting drive
at us. A couple of minor wires were struck, and old
Gott had his clothes torn by a bit of shell. I didn't get
hit. But it sure was a hot dash for home, and we were
a couple of lucky chaps to get there. I got an awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
ragging from the C. O. for being such a fool. Never
again did I drive over the German territory so close to
the earth as 8,000 feet!</p>


<p>III&mdash;"MY BOMBING EXPEDITION"</p>

<p>I did week after week of scout work, driving over
Belgium with observers who noted the movement of
German troops from place to place, or took photographs
of the trenches and the fortifications back of them, or
plotted out the exact location of supply stations and the
like, for the purpose of bombing them later.</p>

<p>That's a snappy sport&mdash;bombing&mdash;but you've got to
watch your step, as you say in the States. You mustn't
forget to let go all of your bombs before you come down,
or you'll be smashed up yourself. I knew one poor chap
who made a landing with two bombs he'd forgotten to
drop. That was the end of him and his machine. There
wasn't much left of either.</p>

<p>It was on a bombing expedition that I met my big
adventure&mdash;the one that landed me in this country, technically
a prisoner.</p>

<p>It was on Oct. 3. Three of us set out with orders to
let go a few T-N-T's on some hangars and supply sheds
the Germans had at Zeebrugge, some forty odd miles
up the coast from our station at Dunkirk. Each of us
had six 75-pound bombs under the body of our machine.
Pretty deadly things those 75-pounders. They'll make
quite a smash. Then I had a dozen or more little hand-bombs,
five or six pounders. They're nasty beggars, too.
You don't want to be too close to the spot where they
land.</p>

<p>We got away in the dark, about 4 o'clock, and, back
of our own lines, climbed till we were about 10,000 feet
up. Then we headed up the coast and got over the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of Zeebrugge just as daylight was appearing. We located
the sheds we wanted, and one after the other of us let
go at them. It's a great thing to pull your lever, let the
old bomb go whizzing down for nearly two miles, and
then wheel around and wait to see what she'll do when
she hits. Of course, you can't hear anything, but you see
a puff, a burst of earth, and, if you're lucky, maybe you'll
see a building go to smash.</p>

<p>Well, it didn't take long for them to know that we were
over them, and they began to let drive with their Archies.
The shells began to burst pretty close to my old R. E. P.&mdash;a
fast, single-passenger monoplane I was driving that
day&mdash;but I stuck around and let drop all six T-N-T's
and hand-bombs. I was separated from the other chaps
by this time, and didn't see them, in fact.</p>

<p>I heard in a roundabout way afterward that one of
my bombs killed fourteen men and four horses. I don't
know whether that's true or not. The story had it that
several of the men killed were Belgians. I hope that part
of it's wrong. But that's the luck of the game.</p>

<p>Pretty soon a bomb bullet burst only a couple of hundred
feet away from me, and right on my level, although
my gauge showed me that I was pretty close to 11,000
feet. I said to myself: "You'd best stick her nose up,
Boydie, or they'll get you. These Archies must be new
ones, for they're throwing steel higher than any I ever
saw before." So I climbed and climbed, circling around,
until I was a few hundred feet over 12,000. There I felt
absolutely safe, and began to look around to see where
I was. I had passed completely over Zeebrugge and was
pretty well up the coast toward a sort of a strait. I
thought I'd best turn around and make back for home
while the making was good. So I wheeled and began to
think about breakfast. The only thing in my mind at the
moment was that I was hungry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>The next thing I knew there was a blinding smash right
in front of me. I realized two things&mdash;that my propeller
was gone and that I was falling like a stone.
They'd got me at last. I didn't know whether I'd been
hit anywhere or not. I just gave everything up and
began to see pretty little pictures of Toronto and New
York and my girl in Cleveland, and all that sort of thing.
Believe me, I was a scared Canadian. It looked like
curtains for J. Errol Dunston Boyd.</p>

<p>But&mdash;you know how it is: if a fellow falls into the
water he tries to swim anyhow, even if he can't. He
does something instinctively to help himself. So I kept
on trying, working my levers without half knowing what
I was doing.</p>

<p>You've seen that "falling leaf" stunt that the trick
fliers do, haven't you&mdash;where the machine just flops
from side to side as it comes down, swinging this way and
then the other way? Well, that's what my old R. E. P.
was doing. Then she'd loop. Some chaps who saw me
coming down said she looped nine or ten times. I'd
looped before, but never involuntarily. I was strapped
in of course, or I'd have beaten the old bus down to the
ground.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;"I DROPPED 12,000 FEET FROM CLOUDS"</p>

<p>I don't know how long it takes to drop 12,000 feet.
The scientists can figure it out. But, believe me, it doesn't
take very long. I was in a sort of a daze from the time
I was struck, but it seemed only a couple of seconds
before I saw the ground right under me, and&mdash;I couldn't
believe it then&mdash;I was right side up and on a decent angle
for landing. I lifted her nose a little bit just before
striking, and, so help me, Bob, I got her on the ground
with scarcely a bump.</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile off were a lot of soldiers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
gray uniforms. They began to run toward me. "Well,
I'll give you German beggars a little row before you stick
me in one of your filthy prison camps," I said to myself.
As soon as I got the old bus to a standstill I unstrapped
myself and jumped out. When the gray-backs got within
a hundred yards of me I let drive at them with my
service revolver. I slammed all seven shots at 'em, but
missed.</p>

<p>I must have been a bit balmy in the bean, for I didn't
notice that they weren't firing at me. Then I did a nutty
stunt. You know we carry "light pistols." They're
things that you use to shoot colored balls of fire with at
night, for signalling purposes, when you're going to land,
and all that. It happened that I grabbed my light pistol
as I jumped out of the seat, so I thought, "I'll give you
this, too, you dirty Boches!" And I shot half a dozen
beautiful balls of fire at them. I was raging mad.</p>

<p>Then they surrounded me. I'm pretty husky, you see.
I've got 180 pounds, and at that time I was hard as nails;
so a couple of them, you can bet, took some good wallops
before a dozen or so piled on top of me and pinned me
down. They began shouting things at me in some language
that I didn't understand.</p>

<p>Finally one of them said in English: "We're not
your enemies. We're not Germans. This is Holland
and we're Dutchmen."</p>

<p>Only then did I stop scrapping with them. They let
me up and stood around me with their bayonets ready
to give me a jab in case I started anything more. It
was some little time before I was able to stop puffing
and give a look around at the scenery. Only fifty yards
away was the border line between Belgium and Holland,
marked by a heavy barbed-wired entanglement and two
or three cables through which ran high powered electric
currents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other side of the fence were a hundred or
more Boches&mdash;patrols who had hoped to capture me if
I alighted on their side of the barbed wire. But I just
beat them to it by a few measly feet. A close shave,
what? And weren't they sore. They yelled over the
fence at me, and shook their fists and guns; but I swore
back at them just as hard as they cussed me.</p>

<p>The Dutch were pretty good to me when I quieted
down. They were decent fellows and were only doing
their duty in grabbing me for internment. They took
me up to a fort in Groningen, and there I stuck from
Oct. 3 until the first of this year, when I was instructed
by the British Government to give my parole. That
meant that I must promise on my word of honor as an
officer and gentleman not to try to escape.</p>

<p>I could have got away, I think. I had all arrangements
made to make a dash from the fort one dark night, have
an automobile waiting outside to rush me to the coast,
and I even had a trawler ready to take me and some
other chaps back to England. But before we were quite
ready to make our dash the word came to give our parole,
and we had to abandon the plan.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HINDENBURG'S DEATH TRAP</h2></div>

<p><i>Story from Lips of a Young Cossack</i></p>

<p><i>Told by Lady Glover</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The authoress heard this remarkable story from the lips of
the young Cossack concerned. It deals with the terrible tragedy
that befell the Russian armies in the early days of the war,
amid that treacherous labyrinth of lakes, rivers, and morasses
known as the Masurian Lakes. This is as she tells it in the
<i>Wide World Magazine</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;THE AGED MOTHER WHO REFUSED TO
FLEE</p>

<p>"Here I was born, and here I am going to die. It is
no use, my son; I am now in the eighty-second year of
my age, and I am too old to be transported to a strange
place. What is to be will be."</p>

<p>Mooska Zarden took his mother's frail hand in his.</p>

<p>"But I entreat you," he said; "the whole of the Russian
population is leaving Dvinsk. There is no time to be
lost; even now the German guns are at the door, and the
Governor's order is that the whole of the civilian population
must be out of the town within twenty-four hours
to seek refuge in a safer place, because the Russian army
is about to take up the line and make a stand of Dvinsk."</p>

<p>"You are a Cossack," she replied, "and must go wherever
you are sent to serve your country; but here I was
born, and here I am going to die."</p>

<p>Dvinsk was a fortified town, or "Kerpost," as it is
called in Russia, but of late years it has been turned into
an arsenal of munitions and material of war, all ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
for the appointed day should the enemy try to cross the
fair River Dvina. The stream at this point is beautiful
and wide; very few bridges span its flowing waters, and
these few were now securely held by the Russians. On
the southern side of the river the country is flat and low-lying,
the land rolling away to the horizon. The approach
of an enemy, therefore, would be distinctly visible, while
the northern banks are well timbered, and higher than on
the southern side, so that an army concealed in the woods,
if well supplied with ammunition, could play havoc with
the enemy when they tried to cross the river from the
opposite bank.</p>

<p>The Germans have by this time learned the reason why
they suffered such an important check at Dvinsk, and
therefore I shall not be giving away any military secrets
by describing the Dvinsk sector of the Dvina line, which
the Russians took up after their retreat from Poland.
It was an excellent one from the strategical point of view,
and one which they have held ever since.</p>

<p>There are three railway lines available, of great importance
for the army&mdash;one from Riga to Oriol, which
follows the line of the Dvina as nearly as possible; the
main line from Petrograd to Warsaw; and a branch line
of the Lembo-Rommy railway, with a junction connecting
the three together. When the Russian army was
about to make a stand at Dvinsk, at the beginning of the
war, the civil population of the town received orders to
leave, and men, women, and children were sent to seek
refuge at a sufficient distance for their safety, out of
reach of Prussian guns.</p>

<p>The terror-stricken people had no time to take their
household goods or the treasures they so much prized;
they simply had to flee, they knew not whither. Vanda
Zarden, however, was not among that stricken crowd.
With bowed head and prostrate form, she was kneeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
before an <i>ikon</i> in the home that had been hers for so
many years, the home she had been brought up in and
where her children were born. Her husband had long
been dead, and her sons were all married except Mooska
the Cossack, the pride of her life and the comfort of her
old age.</p>

<p>The Cossacks of the Don, the distant Carpathian mountains,
and other remote regions are among the most famous
cavalry in the world, and it is the ambition of many
a Russian mother that her boy will obtain a commission
in a Cossack regiment or even a place in its ranks.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Mooska Zarden was only a few hours
old when his father registered his name in Dvinsk as a
trooper. He was determined that one of his sons should
have the distinction of serving the Czar as a mounted
soldier; so Mooska was trained for this branch of the
service, and learned all about horses. When he joined
the regiment it was soon discovered how quickly he could
tame the wildest steeds and teach them many things beside
their drill. His own horse followed him about like
a dog, and would lie down at the word of command.
Mooska also taught him to lift a man in his teeth by the
belt of his uniform and carry him, which was not a part
of the regulation army drill.</p>

<p>And now the hour had come when Mooska must leave
Dvinsk, his native town, and the aged mother who refused
to flee. His heart was heavy within him at the
thought of deserting her in the time of peril; but his regiment
was ordered to join the army that was marching
towards the Masurian Lake district to oppose the advance
of the Huns. This was during the earlier days of the
war, when there was not much known about these wilds
nor about the lake district that proved so full of surprises
for the great Russian armies that were rolling
westwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>There was only one German who knew how to deal
with the invasion of East Prussia, and he was soon busily
occupied. General Hindenburg had a very intimate
knowledge of that particular region, founded upon great
experience, and had studied in detail the strategic and
tactical bearings of this highly restricted field of operations.</p>

<p>He had bought large properties in the district, and
knew every inch of the ground. He had secretly deepened
fords that were marked on the maps and made new
ones that were not marked; he had tested the bearing
powers of the quagmires and guns and wagons, and he
knew just where men and horses might venture and
where they would be swallowed up. Some time before
the war, when it was suggested that a big land company
should be formed to drain the bogs and lakes and turn
them into arable farm land, Hindenburg advised the
Supreme War Lord not to let the project be carried out.</p>

<p>"Those lakes," he said, "are more valuable to us than
two army corps. No guns will be needed if the enemy
advances. You will see when the day comes."</p>


<p>II&mdash;HINDENBURG SAT SMILING IN HIS HOUSE</p>

<p>And now Hindenburg's army was on one side of these
marshes and the Russians were advancing on the other,
and Hindenburg sat smiling in his house, like a spider
in its web, stroking his moustache self-complacently. The
Huns did not trouble much about the advancing troops,
for Hindenburg merely said, "Let them come," and
smiled again.</p>

<p>The events that followed were some of the most tragic
of the war. Hindenburg watched the results of his calculations
surrounded by the <i>Hochgeboren</i>&mdash;the princes
and generals of the army of the Huns. Can it be wondered
that the Duke of Brunswick, who witnessed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
tragedy, has since been reported as hopelessly insane?
At the age of nine-and twenty he was in command of the
German troops at the Russian frontier, and saw the terrible
fate of the men who were swallowed up bodily in
the treacherous marshes. The cries of the victims and
his own helplessness haunted him to such an extent that
it is said he lost his reason and, from extreme violence,
drifted into a deep stupor of melancholy.</p>

<p>Mooska Zarden was among those who witnessed the
terrors of that awful day. Finding the ground soft and
muddy, the Russian engineers were sent forward with
long planks to make a roadway for the troops to pass
over the marshes, little thinking that, owing to the treacherous
nature of the ground, the black slime and ooze
would soon suck down into the bottomless mire the flower
of Russian manhood, and that even the roadway itself
would be swallowed up.</p>

<p>The summer sun had dried the surface crust, and reeds
and sedge and aquatic plants grew and flourished exceedingly.
The Russian army spread out and entered this
treacherous zone at different points, according to the disposition
of the troops and the branches of the service to
which they belonged. Mooska Zarden was riding on the
flank of his troop. The sun beat down fiercely, and it
grew hazy in the distance as the heat drew up the moisture
from the marshes.</p>

<p>Very soon the young Cossack's horse showed signs of
uneasiness and alarm. It is wonderful how the human
voice can restore confidence and courage in an animal
and allay apprehension; but self-preservation is the
strongest primitive instinct, and nothing the Cossack could
do would soothe the terror of his mount. The horses in
front of them were already snorting and whinnying their
fears to each other as the trembling brutes felt the marshy
land quaking under them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Mooska's horse took the bit in his teeth and
bolted back out of the ranks, and bit and spur were of no
avail to make him turn and advance again. The panic-terror
had come; he was fighting for his life, for now
the swamp was giving way and he was sinking at every
footstep. Behind them there was being enacted a scene
that baffles description as the treacherous quagmire began
to claim its toll. The cries and shrieks of men and
beasts as they were engulfed added horror to the dreadful
situation.</p>

<p>Presently, realizing what was amiss, Mooska dismounted
to take the weight off his floundering horse. A discarded
plank that he came across enabled him to struggle
on by pushing it in front of them, and yard by yard man
and beast fought their way to firmer ground, not daring
to stop to rest for a moment lest the delay should be
fatal. By this time the Cossack was almost exhausted,
yet he floundered on with the desperation of despair,
for within view was higher ground which he believed to
be the edge of the marsh. Could he hold out till then?
His panting steed, dripping with sweat and covered with
mud, was&mdash;like himself&mdash;nearly spent, but side by side
they stumbled on, with eyes fixed in that goal which was
their only hope of preservation. At last the earth felt
firmer; they were no longer sinking ankle-deep at every
step. Then the Cossack, taxed beyond his strength, fell
forward on his face, and everything became a blank to
him.</p>


<p>III&mdash;THE YOUNG COSSACK IN THE MARSHES</p>

<p>That bit of dry land, as it happened, was the commencement
of a low ridge of hard ground on the border
of the morass. The exhausted horse stood beside his
master, with legs extended and heaving flanks, turning his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
nose to the wind as he panted for breath. The treacherous
marshes stretched away for miles on every side, and
the panic-terror ran through the animal like an electric
shock. Behind him in the bogs the tragedy wore on to
its climax. Maddened horses broke away, men were
knocked down and rendered helpless, and animals and
humans were sucked down to a dreadful death. The
columns in the rear had hardly left the firm road before
the darkness of night hid the inferno in front, and only
a few stragglers escaped to tell the tale of what befell that
day. When the sun was once more high in the heavens,
the survivors marched back from that dreadful place with
leaden feet, shoulders huddled forward, and red-rimmed
eyes; they were thinking of the fearful fate of their comrades.</p>

<p>As they trudged along the dusty road, the weary men
stepping slowly under the weight of their packs, they saw
a little Cossack horse a short distance from the highway,
with drooping head and tired eyes, standing under the
shade of an overhanging tree beside a motionless bundle
covered with caked mud. The horse whinnied as they
drew near, and lifted his odd-shaped burden with his
teeth. For a few yards he struggled on with it; then he
laid it down from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>"It looks like a man; see if he lives," ordered an officer.
A sergeant came forward and found that the helpless
Cossack was still breathing. How long he had lain there
he never knew, for his faithful horse had carried him by
his belt little by little, yard by yard, from the place where
he had fallen&mdash;five weary versts away, they told him&mdash;till
he reached the shelter of those trees by the roadside. He
had never left his master save for a short time to crop
the herbage or drink from a pool during that long night
and the day that followed. And now, when he could do
no more, help had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mooska Zarden's senses returned to him he
seemed to remember lying in the moonlight during that
long night, with nothing but the stars above him, and
feeling the soft nose of the faithful animal touch his
hand; and he would feebly move it to show that he was
alive. Then his belt would tighten and he would be dragged
on gently for a few yards and laid down again, still
only semi-conscious. Now the soldiers were giving him
restoratives, but he felt little except the throbbing of his
head. He opened his eyes feebly at last, but could not
speak or think. When he was placed on a stretcher the
horse broke away from the man who was leading him
and took his place beside the bearers, every now and then
putting his nose against the shoulder of the prostrate
figure.</p>

<p>"Let him be till we fall in with a Cossack regiment or
some stragglers of his own corps," said the colonel. "He
saved the trooper's life."</p>

<p>When Zarden regained his senses he was in hospital,
weak and spent by fever; his brain had hardly as yet recovered
from the shock. "Have I been ill?" he inquired,
but the nurse told him to lie still and ask no questions.
As yet he could remember nothing. The sun glinted in
through the windows and flecked the white-washed walls
here and there with gleams of golden light. There were
rows and rows of beds in the long ward, placed side by
side, and Red Cross nurses were flitting about among
them. It was all very strange to him. After a while
his eyes rested upon the <i>ikon</i> hanging on the wall. This
was the first time he had noticed it, and his memory
brought him fitful shadows of the last occasion on which
he had seen one. An aged woman, of whom he had but
a hazy remembrance, was kneeling before it.</p>

<p>While he was trying to straighten out the tangle of
mixed-up ideas in his mind, a cry from one of the beds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
in the ward held his attention. "Save me; I am sinking!"
cried an agonized voice. Then, in a flash, he remembered
those pitiful shrieks of despair, and he covered his face
with his hands. Memory, that fickle jade, had come back
at the point where she had deserted him, and he lay back
with closed eyes while pictures floated through his brain
of what he had passed through that dreadful day, followed
by the starlit night when he could hear the troop-horse
cropping the herbage at his side and the strike of
the animal's iron-shod hoofs as he slipped over stones,
weighted with his burden. Soon it all came back to him.
"Bring me a mirror, nurse," he said. It was the first thing
he had asked for. He looked at it; then, with a wild
shriek, he flung it away.</p>

<p>"It is another&mdash;not me! Who am I?" he cried. "My
hair and beard are as white as snow! It is not me,
Mooska Zarden, any more."</p>

<p>The nurse picked up the fragments of the broken glass
hastily, and he lay back raving as he had done in his
fever.</p>

<p>"You must dye his hair and beard at once," the doctor
ordered, "otherwise he will lose his reason. With
care, however, he will recover; it is a nervous breakdown."</p>


<p>IV&mdash;AT THE DOOR OF HIS MOTHER'S HOME</p>

<p>Slowly the Cossack pulled round, as the doctor thought
he would, and ere long he was sent home to recuperate.
The smiling Dvina spread out before him in the early
dawn, with the blue, cloudless sky above and the golden
sun shining on its shimmering water. On the banks green
trees waved in the breeze, and away in the distance the
blurred outline of a town was visible in the purple morning
haze. As he came nearer to the city, however, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the buildings took distinctive objects of Dvinsk, some of
the familiar houses and churches and towers that he
knew so well. It was a city shorn of its beauty, a ghost
of what it had once been. He thought that his recent illness
must have impaired his eyesight, but when he neared
the town and beheld great heaps of stones, roofless houses,
and walls crumbled to dust a great panic seized his heart.
Where was the mother whom he had left there in the
house they called their own? Was it, too, a mass of dust
and stones? With trembling knees he turned to find the
well-known street. A few stray dogs, thin and hungry,
wandered about among the rubbish in search of food. A
strange silence seemed everywhere.</p>

<p>At last he reached his mother's house. Yes, the roof
was still intact; a little broken glass lay about, and there
were marks of shrapnel on the wall, but the house stood
firm and unharmed. This would be about the hour, he
remembered, that his mother would be rising to prepare
the morning meal. He put his hand on the latch of the
door, and his heart was thumping with emotion. Slowly
he pushed it open and entered the little kitchen. Everything
was spotlessly clean and neat, and everything stood
just where he had seen it last. The kettle was hissing
with a welcome sound, and the old black cat was asleep
on the hearth, but the bench beside it was empty. He
looked round, and the morning sun shone on the polished
brasses and lit them up like burnished gold. The pendulum
of the big clock was swaying monotonously as of old,
and pointing to the hour when the household used to assemble
round the oaken table for their morning meal.
As the last stroke of the hour ceased to vibrate, a bent
figure kneeling in front of the <i>ikon</i> raised her trembling
hands to it, clasped in an agony of prayer. "Send him
home to me, good Lord, that I may see his face once
more," she cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Mooska Zarden stooped and lifted the prostrate form
and folded his mother closely to his heart. Then he told
her the strange story of his miraculous escape, and
showed her the well-worn leather belt, with the marks
of the teeth of the faithful horse that had saved his life,
and recounted to her again and again the tale of the
brave animal's pluck and endurance during that long night
and those dreadful days of suffering.</p>

<p>"It was the will of God, my son," she said, earnestly.
"What is to be, now and for evermore."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ON THE GREAT WHITE HOSPITAL
TRAIN&mdash;GOING HOME TO DIE</h2></div>

<p><i>An American Girl with a Red Cross Train</i></p>

<p><i>Told by Jane Anderson, through Courtesy of British
War Office</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is a glimpse of a great organization which brings disabled
British soldiers from the first line trenches to London. She
tells how the wounded who are coming back to England to die&mdash;come
back smiling. "It's 'eaven, I call it," said a bandaged
Tommy of the Great White Train. The story is retold by permission
of the <i>New York Tribune</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;"MY CARGO OF WOUNDED MEN"</p>

<p>From a closed British port to London I made a journey
in a Red Cross train which, with great scarlet crosses
marked on each blind compartment, carried a cargo of
ninety-five wounded men&mdash;a precious cargo of war that
I had seen transferred from the finest of his majesty's
hospital ships to the cots of the ambulance train drawn
up under the roof of the Admiralty pier.</p>

<p>It was through the courtesy of the War Office that I
was permitted to board the hospital ship, to watch the
unloading of it, to see each detail of a very complex and
splendid organization, and to journey to London in one
of the white ambulance trains created and set apart for
the grave and pitiful purposes of war. I am grateful
for these privileges.</p>

<p>I have come closer to the actualities of this war as
it stands&mdash;have penetrated the surface of it. For these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
men who by thousands are returning to England bring
with them, each and all of them, the stamp of it. It is in
their eyes, the horror of it; it is in their words, in their
gestures, the misery and the pain of it; it is written in
their faces, borne witness to by every fold of their stained
and shabby garments. It is France they are bringing
home with them, France and the memory of all the gray
and wretched splendor of war. This is in their faces;
this and courage.</p>

<p>At first, when I walked down the concrete pavement
at one side of the pier, with its railway lines and great,
spreading gray roof, I thought that the hundred men or
more whom I saw sitting on benches in a square, inclosed
place were but one more unit of the soldiers which
throughout England bear testimony to the new army of
the King. But as I came nearer to them, saw them sitting
there, with on one side of them the white coaches of
the ambulance train and on the other, anchored close in,
the great white hospital ship with its broad band of green,
I knew these were wounded men sent home from France.
The slightly wounded men, they call them.</p>

<p>"These are not serious cases," the captain who was in
charge told men. "Shrapnel, mostly."</p>

<p>I looked at the long rows of men in khaki sitting on
the wooden benches, with their coats drawn loosely over
their shoulders, with their bandaged heads and arms and
feet showing a very clear white against the dim and gray
light of the pier. How patient they were, and how tired
they looked! Slightly wounded; shrapnel, mostly. One
of them with his arm bandaged from the elbow to the
wrist and supported in a wide sling; one of them with his
feet wrapped thickly in layers of dressings and covered
over with heavy woollen socks; one of them with his left
hand in a splint and his right arm wrapped in gauze the
full length of it; another man, leaning against the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
next to him, with his thin hands folded across his knees,
and his head and his face almost covered with fold upon
fold of white linen. On his forehead a little round dark
stain widened on the clean cloth. Slightly wounded;
shrapnel, mostly. Such are the terms of war.</p>

<p>Then I went with the captain, who was also the disembarkation
officer, to stand beside the gangway and see the
stretcher-bearers carrying the wounded from the ship.
It was such a fine, spotless ship, with her broad band of
emerald like a big girdle around her. Her great red cross
amidships, that clear and gracious emblem of service,
proclaimed her inviolate, symbolized her, transfigured and
illumined her; she rested, white, splendid, immobile, the
rich sunlight streaming down on her decks.</p>


<p>II&mdash;PALLID FACES ON THE STRETCHERS</p>

<p>On the pier the orderlies were waiting.</p>

<p>Sometimes two of the wounded men would come fumbling
and staggering down the gangway together, holding
to each other. With intense concentration, without any
knowledge of what was taking place around them, looking
neither to the right nor the left, they progressed step
by step, infinitely cautious. They advised each other,
admonished each other, argued in an absorbed, gentle
monotone, wholly engrossed, set apart, dedicated to this
mysterious and immediate moment which lay between
them and the harbor of the benches. With each uncertain
step, with each circumspect, tentative advance, I
think that a new cycle of destiny was spun for them, such
was their earnestness and the simplicity of their world.</p>

<p>Thus, slowly, by open magic, the benches steadily filled.
I don't know how many men were sitting there, nor how
many more men were in the adjoining inclosure. But
while I had been watching the unloading of the ship one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
ambulance train had been filled and had moved out,
slowly, silently, toward her nameless destination. For
each day, as the new offensive on the Western front
fulfills the tragic bartering of men for land, the hospitals
of England register toll for victory.</p>

<p>And this offensive, which has reclaimed territory valuable
beyond estimation, was conceived with accuracy and
true vision. Men were neither squandered nor offered
up in sacrifice. Yet day by day the white ships put into
harbor and the white trains come and go, weaving back
and forth, fulfilling the purposes of war.</p>

<p>And I was watching one infinitesimal part of this....
It was moving very surely and precisely, the grave business
of transference. I saw with astonishment that the
deck was cleared. A little procession of orderlies, bringing
empty stretchers, was marching down the pier. I
had thought that the ship was emptied, so many men in
khaki had passed down the gangway. But I saw, instead,
that the work had but commenced.</p>

<p>For from below they were carrying up other men.
And these men lay quite still on the stretchers, with their
gray blankets drawn close around them. Their faces
were very white, that extraordinary clear white of pain.
But sometimes when they were carried by they smiled.
I think that there were men among these soldiers who
had measured the hours of their journey by their own
agony. Only suffering could have drawn such deep and
searching lines, could have brought such shadings and
such contours into men's faces. There was one boy
who lay with his hands folded on his chest; his eyes
were closed, and the shadow of his black lashes was no
darker than the deep circles which furrowed his cheeks.
There was neither life nor color in his flesh; his hands
had the fine and delicate transparency of a child's hands.
Yet, just as he was being carried by, he opened his eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
made an inscrutable, almost imperceptible, movement with
his fingers as if some impulse had impelled him to a gesture
which must be unrealized. There was, for one swift
instant, the illusion that he smiled.</p>

<p>Yes, there was courage enough among them, these men
who were coming home. I marveled at them; I had never
thought of that particular degree of courage which lies
in the one very simple fact that men&mdash;even those men
who are coming back to England to die&mdash;come back home
smiling.</p>

<p>And I marveled more and more at these miracles of
war when I went abroad the white ship and saw just
what it meant, this long journey of the wounded.
I saw all of the splendor of that big ship only as a background
for the men who had returned in her. Yet certainly
she was both beautiful and splendid. I was told
that once in her history she had come into royal favor;
be that as it may, whatever the purport of her destiny,
she had been fashioned with true understanding. In the
wide sweep of her decks, in the very lines and gradations
of her, there was that character, that abiding character
and personality, which is the inheritance of all good
ships of the sea.</p>

<p>It may be that she suffered a little from a certain lavishness,
not wholly judicious. For her cabins and her
saloons were panelled in woods of many colors and many
grains, inlaid according to the obscure ethics of such
matters. Not that her fine frescos were not decorative,
with their bright cubes and squares and quaint juxtapositions.
They shone like satin; in the borders, golden
and black, the green, brilliant hangings were mirrored,
extraordinarily luminous and rich in texture.</p>

<p>But I liked best her big wards below. I liked their
generous proportions and the clean, wide cots, row upon
row of them. There was, too, that faint, pleasant odor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
of antiseptics and new linen. The copper sterilizers, set
on shining tables, were resplendent in that cool and
colorless interior. The enamelled basins and portable
dressing stands were a brilliant and stainless white.</p>

<p>But, above all, there was in this place a certain very
fine and definitive individuality. I do not know that
there were either details or designs in which it found
expression. But indisputably this was a hospital on board
a ship. It is true that above each cot, suspended, were
two long canvas strips to which were attached a bar
of wood, very much like a short trapeze. By means of
this a patient could lift himself, so that, with his pillows
behind him, he could sit up. Also, there were above certain
cots strips of white cloth. These were fashioned
like big slings, and they had been conceived by genius.
For by the simple means of supporting a bandaged arm
or a bandaged foot in them the vibration of the ship, the
steady throbbing of her engines, was in a very great
measure counteracted. But it was not in these things
that the character of this white saloon was revealed. I
think, instead, that it was concentrated in one quite simple
thing. In this big ward there was but a faint, diffused
light; for above the beds, and screening the portholes,
was a long, unbroken sweep of green curtains, with black
shadows marked in vertical lines. And these shadows,
straight, deep bars on the green cloth, swayed a little,
changed a little, widened and became narrow with a certain
rhythmic, recurrent design. It was the movement
of the ship. It was the inflowing and the outflowing of
the tide.</p>


<p>III&mdash;MYSTERIES OF THE WHITE SHIPS</p>

<p>Then I went up on deck, and there I was shown, that
I might savor all the small attendant mysteries of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
white ship, the officers' cabins and the staterooms for the
nurses. These were, like the saloons, well designed, of
good proportions. They were, too, inlaid with stained
wood, richly patterned.</p>

<p>And I did not like to leave that ship, but a messenger
had come aboard with the word that the train in which
I was to go to London would start within five minutes.
So I went with the captain and with the doctor who was
in charge, and we walked along the platform beside the
doctor's train, walked the full length of it, passing coach
after coach, each with closed doors and a big scarlet cross
painted between the blind windows. It seemed curiously
unlike a train, this hospital.</p>

<p>At the door of the first compartment we stopped, and
I bade the captain good-bye and thanked him. He said
something about hoping that I would not be too late in
making London, and there was the conviction in his
voice that it was, after all, somewhat of a journey that
lay before me.</p>

<p>But to the captain the white ambulance trains and their
safe passage to and fro were but just a part of the business
of the day. While to me, in this momentous step
by which I was to enter the forward compartment, I was
achieving a new world. So many, many times I had
watched the wounded train passing by, slowly, smoothly,
with the clear, broad panels flashing in the sunlight. And
I had wondered what mysterious, what grave and splendid
facts of war, were concealed within that inscrutable
interior.</p>

<p>And I was to journey to London in one of those great
white trains!</p>

<p>I stepped inside; and because the front of the carriage
was two broad windows and because it was the first
coach, I saw, framed in sills of dark wood, the black,
square bulk of the engine, extraordinarily solid and imposing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
Outside, on the platform, the doctor was standing
with his hand on the frame of the opened door.</p>

<p>The engineer leaned out of his cab. The doctor turned,
looked at him, nodded and said, "All right."</p>

<p>The engineer moved back in his seat. The doctor
stepped into the compartment and closed the door. Thus,
in the most casual and engaging fashion, the ceremony
was completed. We were off.</p>

<p>I saw the concrete flooring of the pier moving past on
either side and the columnar supports of the pier roof
gliding by our windows. Through the open arched space
between them I could see the sunlit water and the gray
line of a wharf. Beyond, the tall masts of a ship rose
very black against a brilliant and intensely blue sky.</p>

<p>There was in the compartment a curious impression of
stillness, which I believe was due in great part to the very
size of it. Certainly, it was quite the largest carriage
I had ever seen. By the windows, placed on either side,
were two big couches done in dark blue, with blue cushions;
at the foot of one of them stood a square, closed
desk, with a continental telephone above. There were
also a table and swiveled armchairs, upholstered in gentian-colored
cloth, with gold borders. A vase, filled with
bright flowers, stood on the table; an opened book, turned
face downward, had been left on the couch. And this
was a compartment in a train.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF THE DOCTOR ON THE GREAT
WHITE TRAIN</p>

<p>"We have to do what we can with them," the doctor
said, standing by the desk and turning over some papers.
"We just about live in them, you know."</p>

<p>"This, of course," he explained, "is only a short trip,
comparatively. Sometimes they are rather bad."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anything can happen, you know. Now, there was a
man we had last night&mdash;we knew it was a serious case,
yes. An amputation&mdash;only just got him off the train in
time. There wasn't anything to be done. He died an
hour after." The doctor sat in the corner of the couch,
facing me, looking out of the window where the gray
smoke from the engine whirled against it. "I've never
had a man die on board," he said slowly. "But there are
times&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated, waited a little, then shook his
head. "Yes, there are bad times," he murmured.</p>

<p>He leaned back, took up the book beside him, closed
it and placed it on the desk. His khaki tunic and braided
sleeves, with their three small stars, showed very dark
against the gentian cushions. "It's the responsibility,"
he said, the even, meditative tone of his voice carrying
quite clearly in the curious stillness, "and the uncertainty&mdash;the
fact that you don't know. Anything can
happen....</p>

<p>"There was the night they stopped us and told us
about the Zeppelins.... That was the second time my
train had been bombed&mdash;there was another night, but
that wasn't very bad. But this night the train was
filled up, all cot cases, two amputations, possibility of
hemorrhage. And what are you going to do? You
have to get them to the hospitals. So we went
ahead....</p>

<p>"They were dropping them pretty thick that night&mdash;oh,
yes, we saw it all right. Quite a thing to see, that!"</p>

<p>Then he smiled, that friendly Scotch doctor, smiled
and fumbled with the black cord of his eyeglasses which
had caught on the button of his shoulder strap. "Pretty
show it would have been," he announced, with a certain
gentle causticity, "if they had hit us."</p>

<p>Then he stood up abruptly, waited for a moment to
look out the window where the broad fields were wheeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
past in great squares of color, and said: "There are
one or two serious cases to-night. We'll go back now."</p>

<p>And he walked down and opened the door beside the
closed desk. I saw before me a little narrow vestibule
with mahogany walls. I stepped into this vestibule, one
short step carried me across the threshold; but in this
moment I entered a wholly new world. It was, in absolute
truth, a world complete, self-sustained; there was
not even the illusion of its having any concern whatever
with what was not contained within itself. It was war.</p>

<p>There were, in certain cupboards and certain little
rooms opening off the corridor, bandages, gauze, linen,
instruments, medicines. There was, too, a compartment
of some proportions where a man at a typewriter was
making up the nominal roll. Also, in this extraordinary
world of war there was a kitchen; the cook asked me in
to show me the generous pots of broth simmering on his
stoves. But it was the dressing room, with its enameled
operating table and its brilliant overhead light, which
was the axis of this compact and infinitely tidy little universe.
It was in this room, this room built in a train,
that it had been decided whether or not men were to live
or die.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a bit difficult&mdash;operating here," the doctor
admitted. "What with the motion of the train and all."
But he added hastily that it was not on board ambulance
trains that the true miracles of science and of medicine
had come. It was in the dressing stations, in the casualty
clearing stations, in shabby little rooms under shell fire,
where the light was a lamp or a candle or anything, where
water itself was at a premium. "Nobody believed," the
doctor said, "that surgeons could do what <i>they</i> have
done."</p>

<p>Then we went down a very narrow corridor and, quite
suddenly, I found that we had entered the first coach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
filled with wounded men. It was deep and narrow, with
a white, concave roof. But it was above all a very long
coach, and running the full length of it were two double
tiers of cots. The aisle between these tiers was of good
width and miraculously clean. The cots were wide, with
thick mattresses.</p>

<p>In each of these cots a man was lying. They were
lying as if they were asleep, with their faces turned
away from the light. The coach was very still.</p>

<p>I walked down the aisle, following the doctor. I was
afraid of the movement of the train throwing me against
one of those white cots where those curious, inert, motionless
things were. But the doctor was hurrying along
quite briskly, and explaining to me the amazing new
diseases of this war, talking in a low, veiled, professional
tone and looking at his patients each one, as we passed
by.</p>

<p>"There's, of course, shell shocks," he said. "General
collapse. Nerves simply give way&mdash;can't stand it. The
wear and the strain, and the noise, the horror and the
rest of it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They come home like this&mdash;&mdash;" We had stepped by
one of the cots where a man was lying with his face
turned straight toward the light. His eyes were closed,
his thin, nerveless hands lay, palms upward, on the gray
blanket. The slender veins in his wrists showed very
clear.</p>

<p>"He's been like that perhaps for days," the doctor
said. "Doesn't see, doesn't hear, doesn't feel. Absolutely
unconscious. Total collapse.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes, he'll be all right. It's just time, you
know. Time and care and patience. Like any other
shock&mdash;only ten thousand times greater. It's wonderful
to see how their memory comes back, slowly, slowly....
You wouldn't believe what man can live through. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
wouldn't believe it&mdash;it's only flesh and bone, after all,
you know.</p>

<p>"Then there's this thing of trench feet&mdash;pretty bad
that. Slow rot. Wholly new disease. And for that
matter, there are plenty of them&mdash;not yet even named,
some of them. But, of course, it's mostly shrapnel.
Shrapnel and amazing things...."</p>

<p>And so, like this, we passed through coach after coach&mdash;ninety-five
wounded men there were on board. And
the doctor was stopping every few steps to look at a
dressing or to ask a question. And I was walking behind
him, filled with wonder and amazement. I had not
known it was like this&mdash;the getting wounded men back
from war. They were so patient and so pitiful and so
happy. And I think that they, too, were sometimes filled
with wonder.</p>

<p>For when I stopped to talk to them they said always
that it was a miracle, a miracle being on that train.</p>

<p>"I never knew I was goin' to be 'ere," a Tommy told
me. He was lying, both of his bandaged feet propped
up at the foot of his cot. "They got me in both legs,"
he explained. "Fair an' square. Shrapnel. Two days
I was lyin' out. Two days. No, you wouldn't believe&mdash;an'
I wouldn't either, hadn't I done it. Frightful it
was. H. E. spatterin' 'round everywhere. They were
rippin' things open, them two days. Oh, I was sorter
goin' out o' me mind toward the end of it.... Don't
know where I'd got to&mdash;we was pushin' on. Down I
went. Down I stayed. Wasn't no good tryin' to crawl....
Yes, I was a bit out o' me mind, thinkin' all sort-a
things out there. Two days, an' a night of it thrown in.
'In the legs I'm 'it,' I said to meself. 'Wish they'd
blowed off me arms.... <i>I'm</i> done,' I said. But remember
'em gettin' me hout. Two days I'd 'ad. Two days
in 'ell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I was put in a barn, full up it was, an' they went
an' strafed that. Busted out a whole side of 'er. Saw
'er cavin' in&mdash;frightful noise. 'That's crocked up,' I
said.</p>

<p>"An' now I'm 'ere&mdash;'ere in a train. It's 'eaven, I call
it." ...</p>

NAVAL BATTLE IN THE WAR</h2></div>

<p><i>What Happened When the "Bluecher" Went
Down</i></p>

<p><i>Told by a Survivor of the Ill-Fated German Cruiser</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The narrator's name is withheld because at the time of this
writing he is a prisoner-of-war. His story is related in the
<i>New York American</i>. Copyright, 1915, Star Company. The
armored German cruiser <i>Bluecher</i> was sunk in the great naval
battle off Helgoland, January 24, 1915.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE GREAT SEA BATTLE</p>

<p>We had just had breakfast on the <i>Bluecher</i> when a
fast British scout cruiser hovered for a moment on the
far-distant horizon and then disappeared. We knew at
once that our location was being reported by wireless to
the nearest British patrol ships. Orders were signalled
at once through the German fleet to turn away from the
British shore and steer for home. It was Sunday
morning.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock columns of smoke could be seen on
the far horizon behind us. The enemy were after us&mdash;but
not yet could we see them. Suddenly from the blue
sky above a shell fell near us, with a moaning, groaning
whine. We could see no ship. From somewhere below
the horizon had come this shot.</p>

<p>Nowhere visible were there any warships of the enemy
which our gunners could find for a target. Still out of
the skies above us more shells continued to fall in front
of us, beside and behind us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally the observers at the masthead were able to
make out through their telescopes the tops of the masts
of a ship, but our hull was buried out of sight, and yet
those British gunners in their turrets, who could not see
even the tops of our masts, were rapidly getting the distance
and range of the <i>Bluecher</i> from the fire-control
officers far up in their own mast tops.</p>

<p>At this moment was beginning a naval battle the like
of which had never occurred before in the history of sea
power, for never before have ships of such size and
speed, with guns of such great range and punishing
power, been engaged. This battle, which began between
ships more than ten miles apart which could not see each
other, continued to increase in fierceness of action until
the British pursuers, who had worked themselves up to
the astonishing speed of thirty-four miles an hour, began
to overtake us and rake us at point blank range. Although
the <i>Bluecher</i> was protected by six-inch plates of
armor and six-inch plates on her turrets, we knew that
we were doomed. We were at the mercy of five British
battle cruisers, faster in speed, heavier in armament and
more powerful in guns.</p>

<p>What happened to the <i>Bluecher</i> that Sunday morning
is a story unparalleled by anything in the previous history
of the world. The <i>Bluecher</i> received every imaginable
form of projectile, and as a final kick its end was
hastened by a torpedo from the British cruiser <i>Arethusa</i>.</p>

<p>A curious fact is that our most frightful punishment
came in the early stages of the engagement when the
British ships were eight or ten miles away from us. This
extraordinary occurrence was due to the British thirteen-and-a-half-inch
shells that were fired at such a high elevation
that they came down upon as from the sky, piercing
our unprotected decks and penetrating on through
to the bottom of the ship, where they exploded in the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
vitals of the <i>Bluecher</i>, doing the maximum amount of
damage and destruction.</p>

<p>The British ships, as I have said, were away on the
horizon, more than ten miles distant, when they started
to fire. Shots came slowly at first. They fell ahead and
over, raising vast columns of water; now they fell astern
and short. The British guns were finding the range.
Those deadly water spouts crept nearer and nearer. The
men on deck watched them with a strange fascination.</p>

<p>Soon one pitched close to the ship, and a vast watery
pillar, a hundred metres high, one of them affirmed, fell
lashing on the deck. The range had been found. <i>Dann
aber ging's los!</i> Now the shells came thick and fast,
with a horrible droning hum. At once they did terrible
execution. The electric plant was soon destroyed, and
the ship plunged in a darkness that could be felt. "You
could not see your hand before your nose," said one.</p>

<p>Down below decks there were horror and confusion,
mingled with gasping shouts and moans as the shells
plunged through the decks. It was only later, when the
range shortened, that their trajectory flattened and they
tore holes in the ship's sides and raked her decks. At
first they came dropping from the sky.</p>

<p>This was because the British ships were firing from
a great distance and must aim high in the air in order
that their shells should reach us ten miles away. Thus
it was that the shells falling from above on our decks
found our most vulnerable spot&mdash;for our decks were not
protected by steel armor as were our armor-belted sides.</p>

<p>The shells penetrated the decks. They bored their
way even to the stokehold. The coal in the bunkers was
set on fire. Since the bunkers were half empty the fire
burned merrily.</p>

<p>In the engine room a shell licked up the oil and sprayed
it around in flames of blue and green, scarring its victims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
and blazing where it fell. Men huddled together in dark
compartments, but the shells sought them out, and there
Death had a rich harvest. The terrific air pressure resulting
from explosion in a confined space left a deep
impression on the minds of all of us on the <i>Bluecher</i>.
The air, it would seem, roars through every opening and
tears its way through every weak spot. All loose or
insecure fittings are transformed into moving instruments
of destruction.</p>

<p>Open doors bang to&mdash;and jam&mdash;and closed iron doors
bend outward like tin plates, and through it all the bodies
of men are whirled about like dead leaves in a Winter
blast, to be battered to death against the iron walls. In
one of the engine rooms&mdash;it was the room where the
high velocity engines for ventilation and forced draughts
were at work&mdash;men were picked up by that terrible Luftdruck
like the whirl drift at a street corner and tossed
to a horrible death amid the machinery. There were
other horrors too fearful to recount.</p>


<p>II&mdash;SCENES OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION</p>

<p>If it was appalling below deck it was more than appalling
above. The <i>Bluecher</i> was under the fire of so many
ships. Even the little destroyers peppered her. "It was
one continuous explosion," said a gunner. The ship
heeled over as the broadsides struck her, then righted
herself, rocking like a cradle.</p>

<p>Gun crews were so destroyed that stokers had to be
requisitioned to carry ammunition. Men lay flat for
safety. The decks presented a tangled mass of scrap
iron.</p>

<p>In one casement, the only one, as they thought, undestroyed,
two men continued to serve their guns. They
fired it as the ship listed, adapting the elevation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
new situation. The <i>Bluecher</i> had run her course. She
was lagging, lame, and with the steering gear gone was
beginning slowly to circle. It was seen that she was
doomed, but still the gunfire from the British kept up
with relentless, incessant fury.</p>

<p>Some of the men on board were rendered deaf. The
ship quivered and rocked under the recoil of her own
guns. The deadly British broadsides made her reel.
The guns were torn from their settings and whole gun
crews hurled to destruction. Men hurtled down from
aloft, bruised, bleeding, dead.</p>

<p>Men were swept from the deck like flies from a tablecloth.
Everywhere blood trickled and flowed. It was a
fever of excitement. Men found blood pouring down
their legs, but could not locate their wounds. Men in
authority lost their heads and confusion reigned. Their
nerves could not stand the strain.</p>

<p>A shell would burst in the interior of the ship in a
halo of flame and fire would arise from the deck, though
there was nothing on the deck apparently that could
burn. During the fight one of the sailors noticed the
captain pull up his trousers and search for a wound;
no one could then say whether he was wounded or not.</p>

<p>It has been generally believed that a ship fighting
end-on stands the smallest chance of being hit. That
is what our naval textbooks teach us. But that is no
longer the case.</p>

<p>The effective target presented by an armored ship end-on
is really much greater than when she is broadside-on,
besides, in the former position, losing whatever protection
might be afforded by her vertical side armor. This
is one of the unexpected lessons taught by the ill-fated
<i>Bluecher</i>.</p>

<p>We knew we had more than a hundred miles to go
before we would reach the protection of our mine fields,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
and we knew that the <i>Bluecher</i> had the poorest chance of
any of the German ships, as she was the slowest. Desperate
efforts were made to keep the <i>Bluecher</i> at her
maximum speed, but no matter how hard we tried to get
away we saw the big English ships steadily overhauling
us.</p>

<p>We knew what was in store for us as soon as our
officers were able to make out the outlines of the approaching
ships. We knew the armament and the gun
equipment we had to face. We knew that each of those
oncoming British battle cruisers could throw a weight of
metal 10,000 pounds twice every minute&mdash;a total of fifty
tons of projectiles every minute. Yet through it all some
never despaired of their lives; others from the beginning
gave themselves up as lost.</p>

<p>As the nearest of the English ships drew closer, the
angle of their gun fire became flatter, but still from far
off on the horizon came the shells it seemed to drop from
the skies. After a time we were receiving literally a hailstorm
of shells&mdash;some falling from overhead down
through our decks, some penetrating through the stern
and travelling half way the length of the ship, and still
others coming straight through the sides.</p>

<p>And this was not all. The big British battle cruiser
that led the British line thundered on past us and then
began to rake us with her stern batteries. The gunners
in the stern turrets of the British ship had been standing
idle and restless, impatient to have a hand in the fight.
As this ship drew on past us the rear guns for the first
time had a chance at the <i>Bluecher</i>, and they tore our
bow and forward works with their heavy shells, while
the after guns of the secondary batteries raked our decks
at point-blank range.</p>

<p>We were the first under fire in the action and we were
the last under fire. Practically every English ship poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
projectiles into us. I have never seen such gunnery, and
there has never been the like of it before in the history of
the world. We could not fight such guns as the English
ships had, and before long we had no guns of any kind
to fight with. Our decks were swept by shot, our guns
were smashed and the gun crews wiped out.</p>

<p>One particular shell from a thirteen-and-a-half-inch
gun I remember well. I saw it coming and watched it
burst in the heart of the ship. This single projectile
probably killed and wounded not less than fifty men. We
had our floating equipment handy and soon began to put
it on. Many of the men leaped into the water, preferring
to trust to getting picked up by the British rather than
remain for certain destruction on the doomed and helpless
<i>Bluecher</i>.</p>

<p>It was early in the action that the concentrated fire
of the British guns on the <i>Bluecher</i> landed a shell directly
over our engine room. This slowed up the ship and we
began to drop back. Very soon a second shell reached
the engine room, and we signalled the rest of the fleet,
"All engines useless." In another half hour the <i>Bluecher</i>
was a mass of flame from fore bridge to stern. One shell
pierced the foundation of a turret and set off some ammunition,
causing a deafening explosion and great loss
of life within the turret.</p>

<p>In the midst of the infernal noise and carnage a strange
incident happened. A reserve sailor who stood unoccupied
near one of the gun crews followed the details of
the battle as they were telephoned to the turret from
time to time by the commander. Finally, unable to keep
back his feelings, the sailor produced a violin. While
the guns roared in the turrets and pillars of water were
thrown up by the falling shells he played "The Watch
on the Rhine," and from all sides the men joined in the
song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>Battered above decks, the vitals torn and twisted, and
with many holes in her sides, the <i>Bluecher</i> reeled and
stumbled like a drunken sailor. But it was the torpedo
from the <i>Arethusa</i> that was the final death blow. She
drew alongside, and one of the British officers shouted
through a megaphone a warning in German that they
were about to launch a torpedo. Our men understood,
and many of them took headers into the water.</p>

<p>Steaming within 200 yards of the reeling <i>Bluecher</i>,
the British warship discharged her torpedo, which went
home. The explosion had an appalling result, and none
would have survived if they had remained clinging to the
wreck.</p>

<p>The wounded <i>Bluecher</i> finally settled down, turned
wearily over and disappeared in a swirl of water.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">"TODGER" JONES, V. C.</h2></div>

<p><i>The Man Who Captured a Hundred Germans
Single-Handed</i></p>

<p><i>His Story as told by Himself, set down by A. E.
Littler</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"How the dickens did you do it, Jones?" asked King George,
when he invested Private Jones with the well-earned Cross;
and our readers will echo the question. Here is the answer&mdash;"Todger's"
own modest account of his amazing feat, as told
to our representative at a special interview. It is a story that
will live, a record of dauntless pluck and unfailing cheerfulness
in the face of death that has no parallel even in the glorious
annals of the Victoria Cross. Told in <i>Wide World Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;"TODGER" JONES TELLS HIS TALE</p>

<p>"If I've got to be killed I'll die fighting, not digging."</p>

<p>It was with these words on his lips that Private
"Todger" Jones leaped from the British trenches.</p>

<p>This is the spirit of the soldier who killed several
Boches, and by a wondrous piece of bluff, combined
with consummate valor, took no fewer than a hundred
and two Germans as prisoners. One of the most
highly-placed men in London has described it as "the
doughtiest deed of the war," and the description is fully
merited.</p>

<p>It was with the object of obtaining the story first-hand
from Private Jones's own lips that the writer visited the
little Cheshire town of Runcorn, a place proud of its historic
traditions, but prouder still of Jones, V.C.</p>

<p>Brown-eyed, lithe, clean-cut, and on the slim side is
"Todger," keenly intelligent, with a streak of fatalism in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
his composition that has sustained him through untold
trials, modest as the true hero always is, humorously tolerant
of the worship he is commanding, lavish in praise
of his comrades, yet reluctant to speak of himself.</p>

<p>"Surely," said he, "there has been 'nuff said,' more
than enough, of a thing that was done on the spur of the
moment by a man who kept his head and knew how to use
his gun. But if you want to know what I did, let the official
account speak for me."</p>

<p>And "Todger" handed the cold, matter-of-fact narrative
set forth in the <i>London Gazette</i> as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Victoria Cross has been conferred upon Private Thomas
Alfred Jones (11000), Cheshire Regiment, for most conspicuous
bravery. He was with his company consolidating the
defences in front of a village, and, noticing an enemy sniper
at two hundred yards distance, he went out, and, though one
bullet went through his helmet and another through his coat,
he returned the sniper's fire and killed him. He then saw two
more of enemy firing at him, although displaying a white flag.
Both of these he also shot. On reaching the enemy trench he
found four occupied dug-outs and, single-handed, disarmed
one hundred and two of the enemy, including three or four
officers, and marched them back to our lines through a heavy
barrage. He had been warned of the misuse of the white
flag by the enemy, but insisted on going out after them.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Won't that fill the bill?" observed Jones, but when told
that our readers wanted the story in full, and that it
ought to be set down for the benefit of posterity, he resigned
himself with a sigh. Then, with a smile like a
benediction, he spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was on September 25th that we took a village that I
am forbidden to mention by name, and were just beginning
to dig ourselves in near a wood, when bullets commenced
to whiz past us, wounding one of our men in the
head, and making things decidedly uncomfortable. I felt
the bullets ping-pinging by me, and I said to the officer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
"They're going to make it hot for us, sir, if we don't get
after 'em. Can I get out and have a packet at them?"</p>

<p>"My orders are to consolidate this position," replied the
officer. "You must not go an inch farther, and you had
better get on with your digging."</p>

<p>And dig I did, but as I got up again I saw a chap hit
through the head and another through the thigh. Looking
ahead, I saw what appeared to be a white flag, and
that fairly riled me. My dander was up, and I shouted
to the officer, "What do you think of that, sir?"</p>

<p>"You must get on with your digging, Jones," said he;
but up I jumped, and called out, "If I've got to be killed
I'll die fighting, not digging."</p>

<p>I waited no longer, but dragged out my rifle, flung down
my entrenching tool, jumped out of the trench, and went
across. The Huns were a couple of hundred yards away,
and they could see me coming. One bullet went "sss"
through my steel helmet and four more through my jacket.
There was a sniper in a tree, but I soon counted him
out. On I went, and reached a "bay," or traverse, leading
to the German trench. There were three men in it,
but, jumping in at the end of the trench, I had only one
at a time to deal with. I got my back to the wall, and
they whipped round on me. I always believe in firing
from the hip, and very quickly number one dropped dead.</p>

<p>Before the next man could recover his senses I had
shot him as well, slipped another cartridge in the breech,
and got the old magazine going on the third at a yard
range. The other men fired at me from the entrance to
the dug-outs, but I managed to "get there" first every
time, which is a great thing in jobs of that kind. In the
second traverse there were five chaps standing behind one
another. One of them made for me with his bayonet, but
I bowled him over like the others by the old trick of
shooting from the hip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>


<p>II&mdash;HOW THE GERMANS SURRENDERED</p>

<p>I got the five of them, and some of them made awful
noises, screaming and squealing. I stalked through the
trench, storming and shouting, and, hearing the firing
and the commotion, the rest of the crowd bolted into the
dug-outs. Soon they had all "gone to earth," and I was
there alone. When they got into their dug-outs I had
them. It was just as if you were in a coal-cellar and I
was in the street waiting to pot you as you came up. They
were shouting and screeching, and every time I saw a
movement I let fly.</p>

<p>Eventually they quieted down, and seeing some of
their bombs, a pile of them, on the floor of the trench, I
picked up a couple and sent them flying down the first
dug-out, and they went off all right. Did I tell you that
I was a bomber? I think they felt that the game was up
when the bombs began to drop amongst them, for out
rushed three fine specimens with their hands up and the
usual cry, "Mercy, kamerad!" They had left their equipment
behind them to show there was no monkeying, and
though I felt like laughing at being there all on my own,
I demanded, in a stern voice, if any one of them could
speak English.</p>

<p>One of them called out, "I can."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "what's it to be? Do you want to be
killed or taken prisoners? You can have it either way you
like, for I'm not particular. In fact, I would rather kill
you."</p>

<p>And all, with one consent, actually cried out that they
wanted to become prisoners&mdash;and with Private Jones as
their jailers, too!</p>

<p>I looked round and saw a hollow, so I told the English-speaking
German to order his two mates to get in there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
They had to climb up to do it, and I knew our chaps
would see them from our trench as they got on top.</p>

<p>"How many more are there down the dug-out?" I
asked, and the Boche answered, "About fifteen."</p>

<p>"What about it?" I said, and he replied, "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Do they want killing or what?" said I, and he gasped,
"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You know they're no use?" I said, and he replied,
"Yes, they're helpless now."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said I, "go and tell them what I have
told you&mdash;that they can either be killed or taken prisoners,
and they can bloomin' well please themselves about
it."</p>

<p>And, by gum! he went and told them, and came back
to say they would all be taken prisoners.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said I, "tell them they can come out when
you call, but only one at a time, remember, and any one
of 'em that has as much as a penknife on him, or any
equipment, will be shot dead straight away. Fetch 'em
up one at a time, and tell them that my mates are coming
across in thousands in a couple of minutes, and if they
find anything wrong with me they'll cut you to bits."</p>

<p>I heard him yowling down the dug-outs what I had told
him, and, meanwhile, I got round the cover. Presently
he came back, and said, "Are you ready?" "Yes," I replied;
"call them up, and only one at a time, and no rushing."
He shouted the message, and ordered them out
without equipment. There were eight or nine dug-outs
in all, and they kept tumbling out, and, as they came, I
sent them out of the trench into the hollow I've told you
of.</p>

<p>Lord! I'd expected fifteen and out they came in
scores, and went into my "compound." When they were
all out, I threw some of their own bombs into the dug-outs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
to make sure that there was no sniper left behind to
"do me in." And then I said to myself, "Great Scot!
What am I going to do with this little lot?" I knew I
could eventually rely upon somebody coming from our
trenches, but it was necessary to gain time.</p>

<p>It's not that I want to brag, but I didn't turn a hair; I
just kept my head-piece going. I told them it would be a
very cold night at the place where they were going to,
and suggested they had better get their great-coats. I
graciously permitted them to fetch them&mdash;"two at a time,
and no rushing." They ran, and came in and out, and
each time they passed me they saluted me&mdash;Private Jones!&mdash;and
I sent them to their places. I didn't like the look
of one bloke, and kept half an eye on him. "I think I'll
shoot that chap," I said to the interpreter.</p>

<p>"Don't," he exclaimed, "he very good man." But presently
the "very good man" went for his great-coat, and
when he had got a short distance he made a dash for
liberty. I swung round, clicked my rifle, and got him fair
and square. He rolled over and over just like a rabbit.
It was a snap-shot, but I put one through his head. Then
I turned to the German by me. "Ask them if any more
would like to try to escape," I said. He did so, and they
all jumped up&mdash;they were seated on the ground&mdash;flung
up their arms, and shouted "Kamerad!"</p>


<p>III&mdash;"HANDS UP! I COULDN'T STOP BAGGING
GERMANS"</p>

<p>It fairly tickled me to death, that did, and I couldn't
stop laughing. Why? Well, a bit of fun I once saw at
a pantomime flashed through my mind. A comedian
who played the part of the squire, revolver in hand,
rounded up all the servants, male and female, butlers and
gardeners, and up went their hands. Then he came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
grandfather clock, pointed his revolver at it, shouting,
"Hands up!" and immediately the hands of the clock
whizzed round.</p>

<p>Well, I tell you I roared with laughter at the thought
coming into my mind at such a time, when I was playing
a lone hand, for it looked so comical to see them all
with their hands up&mdash;over a hundred of 'em, hoping
against hope that Private Jones, Kamerad, wouldn't
shoot.</p>

<p>I wondered what was going to happen next, for it was
out of the question that one chap could keep them there
for any length of time. But the bowling over of the chap
who tried to escape was the best thing that could have
happened for me, and it fairly put the fear of God into the
rest. The official report speaks of me bringing in a hundred
and two, but, though I didn't check their numbers,
there must have been nearly a hundred and fifty of them
when I got them into the open, including four or five
officers and any number of non-coms, or whatever the
Germans call them. But before they got into our lines,
over forty of them were killed by our shells, which were
sweeping the ground and clearing things up generally.</p>

<p>But I'm over-running my story. I had scarcely finished
laughing about the clock putting its hands up, when I saw
somebody start from our lines. It was my chum coming
to look for me. He had been asking where I was, and,
when they told him, he said: "If Todger's across there
I'm going to fetch him, dead or alive!" They all thought
I was a "goner," but, when they saw my chum start,
three more chaps&mdash;a sergeant-major, a corporal, and a
stretcher-bearer&mdash;came across with him. Seeing I was
alive, my chum gave me a smack on the face, and couldn't
stop larking.</p>

<p>They helped me to "round-up" the "bag," and we
marched them back to our lines. All the time our guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
were knocking the position to bits, and, as I've said, some
of the shells dropped amongst the prisoners and killed
them. I got a shrapnel wound in the neck from our
barrage, but it wasn't much. Strictly speaking, I suppose
I ought never to have been in the game, but I wouldn't
have missed it for worlds. When I went over my arm
was a bit painful, for I was wounded on September 5th,
and had refused to go into hospital.</p>

<p>Looking back, and thinking over the incident, I feel that
I must have had what the poets call "a charmed life,"
for after jumping out of the trench, and before I had
accounted for the sniper in the tree, a bullet went through
my helmet, and was buzzing round my head-piece like a
marble in a basin, finally galloping down my back and
burning me during the journey. Four or five other bullets
passed through my tunic, but I wasn't aware of it
until afterwards. It never entered my mind that I should
be killed, and I didn't think my time had come.</p>

<p>Asked if he could explain how he was led into the exploit,
"Todger" said, with a grin, "When I saw the first
three men in the bay I knew I was up against something,
but I had been in more than one tight corner before, and I
had learned that the art of warfare&mdash;for the individual,
at any rate&mdash;was to size up a situation quickly, to fire
without hesitation, and hit your man."</p>

<p>"And," inquired the interviewer, "was there no period
during the incident that you felt that the proposition was
too big for you?"</p>

<p>"I should be lying," was the answer, "if I didn't admit
that I was glad, jolly glad, to see my pals come over, but
I was cool as cool could be, and the lesson I applied was
never to lose this (significantly touching his head). The
man who loses his 'nob' is done for. I knew if I had to
go I should, for everybody has his time, that's what I believe,
and I meant to sell myself at a good price. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
when I got the first men in the traverse, and drove the
others back into the dug-outs, I felt that the game was in
my hands. I had them at my mercy; they didn't know
I was unsupported; I cowed them into submission to my
orders; I pictured the end that awaited them if a hair
of my sacred head was singed, and my trump card was
played in making them come out one by one without any
equipment."</p>


<p>IV&mdash;JONES TELLS ANOTHER STORY</p>

<p>Pressed&mdash;and it should be understood that the man
whose deed Sir Frederick Norman has described as "big
stuff" was terribly reluctant to speak of himself&mdash;pressed
to recount some other vivid experiences which have been
hinted at, Private Jones was compelled to admit that
on two or three other occasions prior to the capture of the
hundred and two Germans he had been promised special
mention, but the officers who had noted him were killed
before the opportunity of recommending him for honours
arose.</p>

<p>"It isn't every heroic deed that is noticed," said the soldier.
"Many's the chap who earns the V.C. who never
gets a 'Thank you.' Every lad out there is winning,
though not receiving, glory; they are brave, noble, clean-fighting,
staunch and true men, and if they haven't had
my luck they've deserved it.</p>

<p>"But if you want to know what further part I have
played in this war, and my preparation for the big
slaughter, I may say I was an old Volunteer of the
Cheshire Battalion, and that the skill I acquired as a
marksman sixteen or seventeen years ago led to me being
employed at the Front as a sniper and bomb-thrower. By
trade I am a fitter, and am thirty-six years of age, and I
tried to join the Engineers at the outbreak of war, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
as a Territorial Reservist was eventually posted to the
Cheshire Regiment, and found myself at the Front in
January, 1915.</p>

<p>"Amongst the narrow shaves I have had may be included
a bullet through my pouch, the heel of my boot
blown away, and an explosion of a shell which lifted me
ten yards in the air and lodged a piece of shrapnel in my
shoulder and another piece in my knee.</p>

<p>"Hill 60 was one of my hottest trials, and there I had
my first experience&mdash;second hand, fortunately&mdash;of the
German poison-gas. We had only been relieved the night
before, and wanted a rest badly, but at ten o'clock in the
morning we received word that something had happened
at Hill 60, and it was up to us to try to set it right. We
got through Ypres town to the railway cutting, and there
came under heavy shellfire. Bad wasn't the word for it,
for they were bowling the lads over right and left, and as
we got closer and closer their machine-gun fire was mowing
us down something cruel.</p>

<p>"Eventually we took cover in the railway cutting and
met the Germans coming along four deep. We received
orders to charge, and cleared them off the railway line,
and then we had to start with the trenches. No sooner
had Colonel Scott given the word, as he stood by my side,
than he dropped mortally wounded. We didn't wait for
further orders, for we saw red, and cleared the second
line of trenches. Then we made another charge, and
took the original trench, which had been held by the
Dorsets.</p>

<p>"There they sat, staring at us. 'Matey, you're relieved,'
we said to one, but there was no answer. 'There's some
hot tea waiting for you in Ypres,' we said to another. No
answer. They were dead&mdash;gassed, and we didn't know
then of the diabolical device that had killed them. I was
one of forty-three that went out that night to bomb the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Germans, expecting that another regiment would take
over the trenches from which we had driven the enemy.</p>

<p>"We used up all our bombs, and the Germans began to
bomb us in turn. Our lieutenant was the only man with a
revolver, and he used it until he had no more ammunition
left and was shot. All except three of us and a corporal
were either killed or wounded, and the corporal asked
me if I could lead them back. I did it, and reported to the
company officer, who said he had received reports on
which he was going to recommend me for honours. A
brave officer&mdash;reported from that very day as missing, as
was the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"We also went through the Battle of St. Eloi, which
lasted three weeks. We were at Hill 60 when it was
blown up, and we remained in the trenches for twenty
days, and after just one night out put in another forty-three
days, which constitutes a record either in the French
or British Army for continual fire-trench work. We
were even reduced to the necessity of sewing sandbags
together to serve as a change of 'linen.' When the hill
went up it was a sight one can never forget, while the
shelling of Ypres was more like a mighty firework display
than anything else."</p>


<p>V&mdash;"HOW I GOT A GERMAN CROSS"</p>

<p>"The first trenches I was in were only thirty-five yards
from the Huns. We caught a squad of them working
in the rear of their trench. We soon downed them, but
the others spotted us, and rattled at us for forty-eight
hours. We dared not show our heads above the trench,
but I was acting as guide, and one night I turned out to
look for a N.C.O. who had been sent with a message and
had failed to return. He had had to go through two
woods in the dark, and I made sure he had lost his way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
I took the turn he would have done had he gone wrong,
and after going about two thousand yards I stepped
through a gap in the hedge and got a nice little shock.</p>

<p>"Lying on the ground about a yard from me were three
Huns with helmets, rifles, and full kit! I whipped my
rifle from my shoulder and butt-ended it, meaning to
make a good fight for it. I noticed they did not move, so
I stepped closer in, and saw the frost on their packs.
Then I knew they were dead.</p>

<p>"My first thought was souvenirs. I got in between
the dead men, and was going to begin collecting, when
a star-shell went up, and I soon found I had landed between
our own lines and the Germans. They spotted me,
opened rapid fire, and sent up light after light. I flung
myself into a ditch and waited about ten minutes. I
don't know how I escaped being hit, for the bullets struck
all around me. All thought of souvenirs had gone out
of my head. When they ceased I made a sprint for it. I
did 'even time' that night, and was mighty glad when I
found the missing N.C.O.</p>

<p>"At another place we had a very rough time of it. Hell
seemed to be let loose, for shells were dropping into our
trenches, mortars blew the bags down, we were under
rapid fire from the German trenches, and to cap the game
they had mined the trench and tried to blow it up, but
they had gone too deep, and only one or two of our lads
were buried, and were safely dug out again."</p>

<p>Side by side on the table Private Jones placed his V.C.
and a silver-edged German Cross of the "second degree,"
one the very embodiment of modest worth, the other
blatantly arrogant.</p>

<p>"And yet," said "Todger," looking upon the two emblems,
and then turning his eyes upon a large official
photograph of himself and his flock of a hundred and two
Huns, and anon taking in at a glance a gold watch, a silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
teapot, an illuminated address, and other public tributes
to his valour&mdash;"and yet, next to the V.C., I think
more of that Iron Cross than of all the rest, and God
knows how much I appreciate all that my fellow-townsmen
have done for me.</p>

<p>"But it's quite another story," he protested, when asked
for an explanation. "I won that Cross in a single-handed
joust with a company commander of the First Prussian
Guards. And I don't think the poor chap had ever had
the chance to wear it! But he had to go, for there was
only him and me for it, and I didn't see why Jones should
be turned down.</p>

<p>"The fact is, it was the last scrap I was in before I won
the V.C., and it was there that I got wounded in the
shoulder. I don't think there's any harm in telling you
it was at Guillemont&mdash;Mouquet Farm and the stronghold
around. The Germans had beaten back all attempts
to take it from them. Division after division had tried
to wrest it from them and had failed.</p>

<p>"Then they brought up our division, and once again
we were told that we had been called out to do what
others had failed to do. It was a terrific struggle, and
we were repulsed four times. Our company had to take
the lead at the fifth charge. The bombers won through
and leaped into the trench.</p>

<p>"We knocked the machine-gunners over and helped
the following waves to get through with little loss. It
was a terrible journey&mdash;the worst, I believe, that I have
been through.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm coming to the Iron Cross by degrees. I had
a wild three minutes, a rare good do. We got rid of those
about us, and I rushed into the next traverse and met my
man, a fine big chap, full of fight, a commander of the
swell crowd, the First Prussian Guards.</p>

<p>"He made for me with bayonet, but I knew too many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
tricks even for a Prussian Guard, and I soon settled him.
The Iron Cross, in its little case, fell from his inside-pocket
as he dropped. It's new; I suppose he'd just received
it from the Kaiser. Poor beggar! I'll never forget
him when I look upon the Cross I won from him in
fair fight.</p>

<p>"We were then reinforced, and advanced another
three thousand yards past Guillemont and dug in, being
too exhausted to go any farther. We stayed there until
relieved in the early morning, when we went into support
about six hundred yards behind, and the shelling was very
heavy. It was here I got wounded. It happened in this
way.</p>

<p>"A party was lost, and I told them I would take them
down for a drink, as they had been without food and
water for over sixty hours. I got them to the place they
had to stay at, got the water, and was making back when
one of the big shells plumped alongside me and lifted
me about ten yards, a piece getting me in the right
shoulder and leg.</p>

<p>"I refused to go down the line, and though my arm
was useless for a day or two, and was a bit stiff and painful
when I won the V.C., it was all a streak of luck, for
if I'd gone to hospital I should have missed the funniest
round-up I've ever seen."</p>


<p>VI&mdash;"IT WAS JUST MY LUCK!"</p>

<p>And with this Private Jones was brought back to his
starting-point. He simply blushed when reference was
made by the interviewer to some of the things that have
been said and some of the eulogies passed upon his prowess.
He admitted that he was filled with pride when he
was ushered into the presence of the King to receive his
decoration. "I was a bit flustered at first," said "Todger,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
"but His Majesty made me at home. One of the
first things he said to me when the record was read was,
'How the dickens did you do it, Jones?' I won't tell you
what I answered on the spur of the moment, but the King
laughed, and so did I. 'It was just my luck,' I said to
His Majesty. 'I was like a man with his back against the
wall, and I kept my head.' And then I gave him an idea
how the thing had been done, and he laughed at the
thought of me fetching home my happy little family."</p>

<p>Throughout the recital Private Jones made no secret of
the fact that his nickname is "Todger."</p>

<p>"Why 'Todger'?" I inquired, and the V.C. man
chuckled just as one may imagine he chuckled when he
remembered the pantomimic hold-up.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you'd come round to that," said he, "but
there it is, and there's no getting away from it. I was
'Todger' at school, and 'Todger' followed me to France.
It's like this. As a boy at school I played football, and I
suppose I was a bit tricky or artful when it came to
dribbling. My school-fellows nicknamed me 'Dodger,'
but my front name is Tom, and it wasn't long before it
was 'Todger' this and 'Todger' that. It was 'Todger' with
everybody at the Front, and lots of 'em seemed to know
me by no other name."</p>

<p>Runcorn feels itself honoured by Jones's wonderful
prowess. Thousands of people met him upon his return;
a marble tablet is to record his deeds. His employers
have provided his parents with an annuity of fifty pounds
per year, he has received a gold watch, an illuminated
address, framed photographs, a smoker's cabinet, a silver
wrist-watch, a silver teapot, a case of cutlery, field-glasses,
and a host of other things. He has also had a
civic reception at Chester, been entertained at dinner by
the Cheshire Regiment, chaired round the Castle square,
and been photographed and filmed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AN OFFICER'S STORY</h2></div>

<p><i>Retold by V. Ropshin, translated from the "Niva,"
Petrograd, for "Current History"</i></p>


<p>I shouted, "Forward!" jumped over the parapet, and
ran forward over the field of beetroot. I remembered
that I was an officer, and must keep in front of my
men.</p>

<p>I heard no shots. At the German trench I felt a blow
on my shoulder, just as if some one had hit me with a
riding whip. But I did not at first realize that I was
wounded. Without stopping, we leaped across the
trench. When we were across it I felt a sudden catching
of the breath, and everything went black before my
eyes. On the right was a deep funnel, the crater of a
12-inch shell. I jumped into the crater.</p>

<p>The funnel was wide, with crumbling edges, and with
a sticky, clayey bottom. I sat down on the damp earth
and felt that my arm was very sore. I struck a match
and began to smoke.</p>

<p>Now I heard the thunder of guns; I distinguished the
rattle of howitzers and the whistle of bursting shells.
I had a feeling of depression. Involuntarily I closed
my eyes.</p>

<p>I sat a whole hour unconscious in this way. When I
came to myself I saw a German in front of me, a German
officer, in a gray-green cloak and with a round cap of the
same colour. The officer was standing straight before
me, and was looking me in the face. I tried to rise, but
he said in French:</p>

<p>"You are my prisoner! Sit down!" and he covered
me with his revolver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>I answered: "Shoot!"</p>

<p>I felt certain that he would shoot me. But he unexpectedly lowered his
arm. His face was tanned, with thick, dark hair and wide, blue eyes.
After a short silence he said:</p>

<p>"I could shoot you&mdash;but I do not want to. We are both prisoners in this
hole!"</p>

<p>And he added, saluting: "I am a Captain in the 238th Prussian Regiment;
Müller!"</p>

<p>I also gave him my name. We were now sitting at opposite sides of the
hole, he a German and I a Frenchman. We remained silent. We both felt
awkward, and I tried not to look at him. At last he said:</p>

<p>"You are wounded?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Allow me! I shall fix a bandage for you!"</p>

<p>I answered: "Pray, do not trouble yourself!"</p>

<p>But he came over to me and pulled out cotton wadding and bandages. And
as he touched me with his hands I experienced a curious transformation.
He ceased to be a German, a detested enemy, a man who wanted to shoot
me, one of the armed bands whose presence pollutes our land. He was
simply Captain Müller, my chance and already kind acquaintance.</p>

<p>He bandaged me skillfully and rapidly. When he had finished he smiled,
and said in German: "So!"</p>

<p>I thanked him in French: "Merci!"</p>

<p>Then we sat together, once more in silence. The firing did not
diminish, and sometimes the bombs burst near by, quite close to us. The
earth trembled, a dark, narrow column rose up, and we were spattered
with dirt, with lumps of earth, and smoke. But neither I nor the German
stirred. We did not wish to show that we were afraid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward evening the fire grew more intense. The German was now listening
to the guns.</p>

<p>"That was yours; that's mine; that's a 120, that's a 75, that's a 77,
that's another 75."</p>

<p>My arm was numb and ached severely. I said: "Will you kindly get a
flask out of my pocket? I have some cognac."</p>

<p>We drank some brandy, both from the same bottle. First he, then I; and
when we had drunk from the same bottle he blushed and raised his big,
blue eyes.</p>

<p>"You are married?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I am married."</p>

<p>"Have you any children?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;two."</p>

<p>He rose and said, with a wave of his hand: "I own a brickyard over
there, in Hanover. I am a peaceful man. I have managed the brickyard
all my life. I wanted peace&mdash;and I have gone to war. And now we are
living like moles. We sleep in the water. We risk our lives every
minute. People have gone mad. Black has become white, and white black.
Tell me, why are we fighting?"</p>

<p>"Your Wilhelm wanted it!"</p>

<p>"Ach! Wilhelm! And did my children want war? Wilhelm wanted it and they
did not want it. And I obeyed not them, but Wilhelm! And here I am, on
French, on foreign soil, beside you, in this hole; and perhaps I shall
die to-day. I shall die, or you will. They will kill me or you. Why?
What for? For Germany? For my brickyard? When will this war end? When
will we go home again? Or shall we not go home? Tell me, why are we
fighting?"</p>

<p>I wanted to answer him. I wanted to tell him that we Frenchmen were
defending our country, and that the Germans were bandits, not guests!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
But I suddenly felt that I was thrown up into the air, that it had
become hot, that there was a rank smell of smoke, and that everything
about me was red. This lasted a second&mdash;or it may have been a
year&mdash;and when I came to myself I saw the blue sky overhead. I
made an effort to rise. I noticed that the crater was smashed down
at the edge, and had grown smaller and deeper. From beneath the
overturned, damp earth a pair of boots stuck forth, worn at the heel;
and beside them, close to me, lay an officer's cap, with the brim torn
off. I understood&mdash;my companion had been killed. My arm ached;
I stumbled and lost consciousness. During the night the men of my
regiment picked me up.</p>
